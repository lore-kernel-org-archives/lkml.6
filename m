That's nothing new and already handled today.

So it's a bit difficult, but you fail to explain why it's not sufficient.

Well, I don't really understand what is solved easily and you are merily
describing the fact that the new callback allows drivers to customize
something. What's the rationale? If it's just the 'bit difficult' part,
then what is the reason for not making the core functionality easier to use
instead of moving stuff into driver space again?

NVME is not special and all this achieves is that all drivers writers will
claim that their device is special and needs its own affinity setter
routine. The whole point of having the generic code is to exactly avoid
that. If it has shortcomings, then they need to be addressed, but not
worked around with random driver callbacks.

Thanks,
