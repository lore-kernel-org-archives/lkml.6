According to my debug, yes.
Using JTAG, I was able to determine that the ESRT memory region was 
getting overwritten by the secondary kernel in 
kernel/arch/arm64/kernel/relocate_kernel.S - specifically the 
"copy_page" line of arm64_relocate_new_kernel()

With -d, I see

get_memory_ranges_iomem_cb: 0000000009611000 - 000000000e5fffff : System RAM

That overlaps the ESRT reservation -
[ 0.000000] esrt: Reserving ESRT space from 0x000000000b708718 to 
0x000000000b7087f0
