This appears to be an implementation rather than architectural issue. If
there is limited <-> limited CM, then the MAD would never get up to the
CM layer as it would be filtered by end port pkey enforcement. This is
only needed to protect against current code which can send on the full
rather than limited pkey (in BTH), right ?

Which OpenSM flavor are you talking about (upstream, MLNX, or other) ?
What is OpenSM version string ? Is allow_both_pkeys TRUE or FALSE ?

Not exactly sure what you mean by RDMA CM does this as there are a
number of different ways to use RDMA CM. Are you referring to using
IPoIB for address resolution ? Another way is for a path record to be
passed in from user space and there is no control over it's contents.

At a minimum, I think the comment mentioning MGID should be clarified.

Agreed. I think that there are other components too...

This is the backward compatibility for the current behavior on the
active side so that REQ gets rejected rather than accepted, right ?

In general, the approach used when there is pkey mismatch is to silently
drop packet rather than respond which causes a timeout on the requester
side. In this specific case, I'm not sure which approach is better.

Also, is there a similar issue with SIDR_REQ ?

> Read me correct, I am also in favour of fixing the OpenSM to not return a valid (but useless) path record in this case.

Understood and agreed.
