Yes, that would be a problem if something changes the MSI vectors out
from under us. Seems like that would be a bit difficult to do even with
regular hardware. So far I haven't seen anything that would do that. If
you know of where in the kernel this happens I'd be interested in
getting a pointer to the flow in the code. If that is the case this MSI
stuff will need to get much more complicated...

I've tested with irqbalance running and haven't found any noticeable
difference.
