Ok, that's it.

I disagree with Google's syzbot strategy, and I dissent most vehemently!

The whole point of constructing free software in public is that we
people communally build things that anyone can use for any purpose and
that anyone can modify.  That privilege comes with a societal
expectation that the people using this commons will contribute to the
upkeep of that commons or it rots.  For end users that means helping us
to find the gaps, but for software developers at large multinational
companies that means (to a first approximation) pitching in to write the
code, write the documentation, and to fix the problems.

Yes, there are many places where fs metadata validation is insufficient
to avoid misbehavior.  Google's strategy of dumping vulnerability
disclosures on public mailing lists every week, demanding that other
people regularly reallocate their time to fix these problems, and not
helping to fix anything breaks our free software societal norms.  Again,
the whole point of free software is to share the responsibility, share
the work, and share the gains.  That is how collaboration works.

Help us to improve the software so that we all will be better off.

Figure out how to strengthen the validation, figure out how to balance
the risk of exposure against the risk of nonfunctionality, and figure
out how to discuss with this community.  That is how the game works.

Google has enough money and smart people that you have (collectively)
learned how to spoof humans, so you can well afford to spend a small
fraction of that hiring some developers and writers and putting them to
work with us.

If you refuse to do this, you already /have/ a config option to turn off
the 'known buggy/unmaintained code in [your] kernel'; use it.  I will
not repeat this message again[1].
