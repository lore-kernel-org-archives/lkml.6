Yes, that's because of the loop in:

   dequeue_task()
     uclamp_cpu_dec()
       uclamp_cpu_dec_id()
         uclamp_cpu_update()

where buckets needs sometimes to be scanned to find a new max.

Consider also that, with mapping, we can more easily increase the
buckets count to 20 in order to have a finer clamping granularity if
needed without warring too much about performance impact especially
when we use anyway few different clamp values.

So, I agree that mapping adds (code) complexity but it can also save
few cycles in the fast path... do you think it's not worth the added
complexity?

TBH I never did a proper profiling w/-w/o mapping... I'm just worried
in principle for a loop on 20 entries spanning 4 cache lines. :/

NOTE: the loop is currently going through all the entries anyway,
      but we can add later a guard to bail out once we covered the
      number of active entries.
