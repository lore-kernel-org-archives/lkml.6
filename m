Isn't the job of the memory model to formalise the guarantees provided by
the implementation? Your diff appears to do exactly the opposite.

This is completely unrealistic. Have we already audited the kernel for the
current definition of the memory model? Should we revert it until we have?

Of course not.

Right now, LKMM offers stronger guarantees that can portably be relied upon
in the codebase. Alan's patch fixes that, and holding back a fix for a known
issue runs counter to kernel development best practices.

I'm very confused by your statements hypothesising about where our opinions
may lie. We've discussed this to death, and it's clear that everybody who's
commented apart from you is happy to weaken acquire/release but leave
locking alone. Alan's written a patch to that effect which, again, only you
seem to have a problem with.

The problem isn't about "if we agree foo" or "if we don't agree bar", the
problem is that you're the only person raising an objection, so please can
you provide a constructive argument against Alan's patch, rather than a
confusing monologue of "what-if"s and unreasonable demands of anonymous
contributors? We don't have to solve all of our problems before we can
make any progress.

Thanks,

Will
