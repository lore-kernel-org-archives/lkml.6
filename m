It's not really a widget specific to this IP. It's just a GPIO. It so
happens that both SDIO and PCIe designs have wanted to use a GPIO for
wakeup, as many other devices do. (Note: it's not just cheap ARM
devices; pulling up some Intel Chromebook designs, I see the exact same
WAKE# GPIO on their PCIe WiFi as well.)

You should search the PCI Express specification for WAKE#. There is a
clearly-documented "side-band wake" feature that is part of the
standard, as an alternative to in-band TLP wakeup. While you claim this
is an ancient thing, it in fact still in use on many systems -- it's
just usually abstracted better by ACPI firmware, whereas the dirty
laundry is aired a bit more on a Device Tree system. And we got it
wrong.

I'm not sure this is really a Marvell-specific problem. (Well, except
for the marvell,wakeup-pin silliness, which is somewhat orthogonal.) In
fact, if we cared a little more about Wake-on-WiFi, we'd be trying to
support the same (out-of-band WAKE#) with other WiFi drivers.
