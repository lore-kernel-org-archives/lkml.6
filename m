Hi Jens,

I have rebased the patchset against the for-4.21/block branch, but I
can't test them properly because the compiling process has an error on
a different file. In particular:

include/net/xfrm.h:1465:3 error: unknown type 'spruct'
include/net/xfrm.h:1465:30 error: expected ':', ',', ';', '}' or
'__attribute__' before 'auth'

To be clear, and so that you can check I haven't made some trivial
mistakes: I have added/fetched the remote [1] and then simply rebased
against the for-4.21/block branch.
