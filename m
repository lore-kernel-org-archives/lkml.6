Hmm.

Or SOME_SILLY_PREFIX ENCLU?

But userspace wants to know whether it was a fault or not.  So I think
we either need two landing pads or we need to hijack a flag bit (are
there any known-zeroed flag bits after EEXIT?) to say whether it was a
fault.  And, if it was a fault, we should give the vector, the
sanitized error code, and possibly CR2.

Same prefix here, right?

This whole thing is a bit odd, but not necessarily a terrible idea.

Yes, but I was imagining that it would stash the registers into the
struct host_state thing I made up :)
