The DMA API handles the SEV case perfectly.  Its just that virtio_blk
supports huge segments that virtio does not generally support, but that
is not related to SEV in any way.

No, the above happens only when we set IOMMU_PLATFORM.

No.  The problem is that we still haven't fully specified what
IOMMU_PLATFORM and !IOMMU_PLATFORM actually mean.  Your
"ACCESS_PLATFORM/ORDER_PLATFORM" commit in the virtio-spec repo
improves it a little bit, but it is still far from enough.

As a start VIRTIO_F_ORDER_PLATFORM and VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM
absolutely MUST be set for hardware implementations.  Otherwise said
hardware has no chance of working on anything but the most x86-like
systems.

Second software implementations SHOULD set VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM,
because otherwise we can't add proper handling for things like SEV or
the IBM "secure hypervisor" thing.

Last but not least a lot of wording outside the area describing these
flags really needs some major updates in terms of DMA access.
