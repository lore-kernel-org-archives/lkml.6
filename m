When we went here, means it is not flutter, something must change,
either the device type or the phy address. Then we call
sas_discover_new(). And sas_discover_new() sure *have* effect in this
case. Please check sas_discover_new() carefully.

If SAS address did not change, the device type must changed, otherwise
it will be a "flutter" and won't get here. So if the device type
changed, do we have a reason to keep the device? I don't think so.
