Hi Doug,

Patch looks good to me, I just have some minor comments.

I think the convention is to always declare local variables at the
start of the function? Although I couldn't find anything in the coding
style document...

You are calling .of_map_mode and assigning the return value twice here.

If you post a new version, feel free to add:
