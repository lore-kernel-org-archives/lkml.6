It's set to 3 seconds. The difference between let's say
C-A9 pandaboard (that is working) compared to C-A15 omap5-uevm
is that the C-A15 has arch_timer in use. Other than that things
should behave more or less the same way.

Hmm so could it be that we now rely on timers that that may
not be capable of waking up the system from idle states with
hrtimer?

Tony
