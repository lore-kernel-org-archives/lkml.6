Some variables maybe (ISTR variables for things like the system 
time-zone or the firmware locale settings, which _might_ be useful), but 
I would say the boot variables are not on that list.  The only practical 
application for a regular (non-root) user to read those variables is to 
gather info for an attack on the system.  Anybody who legitimately needs 
to access them (either for debugging the boot process, or changing the 
boot options) should have administrative access to the system anyway, 
and even then they will usually not need to read them.

In fact, most of the UEFI variables fall into the same category, but 
even more so, userspace has no legitimate reason to need to read them. 
You can get an absolutely insane amount of info out of them on some 
systems, most of which is a gold-mine for potential attackers.  For the 
handful that may actually be useful to userspace, most would be needed 
only during system startup, and thus could safely be made readable by 
root only.

There really isn't any other option unless you're willing to put a small 
amount of flash storage in the system somehow (maybe a small USB flash 
drive connected directly to a USB header inside the system?).  As far as 
the security of UEFI variables, the same limitations as storing the data 
on an unencrypted hard drive apply, with the addition that it's much 
easier to get at them through stuff like Intel's AMT or IPMI than it is 
to read data off of the hard drive.
