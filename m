Hmm, why do we need to do the key switch in assembly, given it's not
used in-kernel right now?

Is that in preparation for in-kernel pointer auth usage? If so, please
call that out in the commit message.

For consistency with the other strings, can we please make this "PAC"?

Huh, so we're actually doing the switch in C code...

... which adds a load of boilerplate for no immediate gain.

Do we really need to do this in assembly today?

Thanks,
