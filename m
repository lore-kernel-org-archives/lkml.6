Either would be an improvement over ccontainerid/containerid.  I would
give a slight node to child_cid/parent_cid just for length reasons.

That's fine, but you have to admit that ccontainerid/containerid is
awkward and not easy to quickly differentiate :)

I would definitely appreciate contid/cid or similar, but I don't care
too much either way.  As far as terminal width is concerned, please
make sure your code fits in 80 char terminals.

Okay.  We've had some many discussions about this both on and off list
that I lose track on where we stand for certain things.  I think
preventing task movement is fine for the initial effort so long as we
don't prevent adding it in the future; I don't see anything (other
than the permission checks under discussion, which is fine) preventing
this.

Yeah ... those are two different things.  I've been wondering if we
should introduce a set/inherited flag as simply checking the parent
task's audit container ID isn't quite the same; although it may be
"close enough" that it doesn't matter in practice.  However, I'm
beginning to think this parent/child relationship isn't really
important beyond the inheritance issue ... more on this below.

The audit container ID *must* be inherited, I don't really think
anyone is questioning that.  What I'm wondering about is what we
accomplish by comparing the child's and parent's audit container ID?

I've thought about this a bit more and I think we are making this way
too complicated right now.  We basically have three rules for the
audit container ID which we need to follow:

1. Children inherit their parent's audit container ID; this includes
the magic "unset" audit container ID.
2. You can't change the audit container ID once set.
3. In order to set the audit container ID of a process you must have
CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL.

With that in mind, I think the permission checks would be something like this:

[SIDE NOTE: Audit Container ID in acronym form works out to "acid" ;) ]

  int perm(task, acid)
  {
      if (!task || !valid(acid))
         return -EINVAL;
      if (!capable(CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL))
         return -EPERM;
      if (task->acid != UNSET)
         return -EPERM;
      return 0;
  }

I didn't think so either, but I didn't do an exhaustive check.

I know ptrace makes use of real_parent when re-parenting the process
being ptrace'd.

All the more reason to go with the simplified approach above.  I think
the parent/child relationship is a bit of a distraction and a
complexity that isn't important (except for the inheritance of
course).
