I think I tried to solve the exact issue some time ago, see:

  https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199581

I verified with the same setup that with your patch applied the above
problem is gone, so your patch solves that issue :)

I fully agree.

I tested this patch with pretty much all the native enumeration systems
I have here and I don't see any issues with it.

So feel free to add my

Tested-by: Mika Westerberg <mika.westerberg@linux.intel.com>

I have couple of minor comments, see below.

You may add here following line as it solves that issue:

I think here you can write

	if (!hotplug_bridges)

instead.

My preference would be to write them like this:

		io.end = io.start + io_per_hp - 1;
		mmio.end = mmio.start + mmio_per_hp - 1;
		mmio_pref.end = mmio_pref.start + mmio_pref_per_hp - 1;

Ditto.
