It is set by device driver when userspace do mmap(fd) where fd comes
from open("/dev/somedevicefile"). So it is set by device driver. HMM
has nothing to do with this. It must be set by device driver mmap
call back (mmap callback of struct file_operations). For this patch
you can completely ignore all the HMM patches. Maybe posting this as
2 separate patchset would make it clearer.

For instance see [1] for how a non HMM driver can export its memory
by just setting those callback. Note that a proper implementation of
this should also include some kind of driver policy on what to allow
to map and what to not allow ... All this is driver specific in any
way.

Jérôme
