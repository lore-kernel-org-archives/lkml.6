In fact, there have have been _two_ proposals along this line.  One as
you describe here (which is what the 1/7 patch under discussion does),
and another in which unlock-lock sequences and atomic acquire-release
sequences both have "RCtso" semantics while ordinary acquire/release
sequences have RCpc semantics.  You should consider the second
proposal.  It could be put into the LKMM quite easily by building upon
this 1/7 patch.

Have you noticed any part of the generic code that relies on ordinary 
acquire-release (rather than atomic RMW acquire-release) in order to 
implement locking constructs?

How about this fourth approach?
