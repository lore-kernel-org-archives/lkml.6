Either way works. The thing is that casting threshold_us to u64 may  
imply that there is something wrong with threshold_us, which does not  
seem to be the case. So adding the suffix ULL to the constant 1000 is  
good enough to make the expression be evaluated using 64-bit  
arithmetic instead of 32-bit.

But, again, either way works.

The proposed patch was due to fact that currently threshold_ns is of  
type u64. But based on the following piece of code (which is the only  
piece of code from where encode_l12_threshold is being called):

          * Based on PCIe r3.1, sec 5.5.3.3.1, Figures 5-16 and 5-17, and
          * Table 5-11.  T(POWER_OFF) is at most 2us and T(L1.2) is at
          * least 4us.
          */
         l1_2_threshold = 2 + 4 + t_common_mode + t_power_on;
         encode_l12_threshold(l1_2_threshold, &scale, &value);

It seems to me that it makes no sense for threshold_ns to be of type  
u64, because the expression threshold_us * 1000 will never exceed the  
32-bit limits. So if you agree I can send a patch to change its type  
to u32 instead.

Thanks
