That's what your commit log looks like, yes. This is your full commit
log:

   In preparation to enabling -Wimplicit-fallthrough, mark switch cases
   where we are expecting to fall through.

   Warning level 3 was used: -Wimplicit-fallthrough=3

   This code was not tested and GCC 7.2.0 was used to compile it.

   For all I know, you could've run spatch to add the comments wherever
   there was no break, and then compiled it once.

That's great.

Indeed, that looks like a bug, although kinda benign since it just means
TKIP will always use software crypto and TKIP is slow anyway ;-)

I'd be happy if you were to actually just mention that you've looked at
them, and found them to be expected fall throughs. I'll still review
them, but without that information I feel like I'm doing the first round
of reviews this code ever got.
