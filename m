Can you please provide me with a full log of the issue ?

What is the bug this patch is actually fixing ?

I assume you mean a type 1 config header here. I do not think it
is mandatory for a host bridge to have a type 1 config header
(and related bridge windows + primary/secondary/subordinate bus
numbers) but I do not know how the IP you are programming is
designed.

If the host bridge needs its memory window to be configured you can
easily do that in the driver (with driver specific code) without
requiring the generic PCI resource core to do that for you, the host
bridge is the root of the bus I do not see any reason why it should
be up to core PCI code to assign it, it is preprogrammed.

I want to understand where the problem is and whether it is right to
define the component as a PCI bridge rather than a host bridge.
