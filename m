Do you think these devices that don't support internal DMA between
functions are within spec, or should we handle them as exceptions,
e.g., via quirks?

If NVMe defines a flag indicating peer-to-peer support, that would
suggest to me that these devices are within spec.

I looked up the CMBSZ register you mentioned (NVMe 1.3a, sec 3.1.12).
You must be referring to the WDS, RDS, LISTS, CQS, and SQS bits.  If
WDS is set, the controller supports having Write-related data and
metadata in the Controller Memory Buffer.  That would mean the driver
could put certain queues in controller memory instead of in host
memory.  The controller could then read the queue from its own
internal memory rather than issuing a PCIe transaction to read it from
host memory.

That makes sense to me, but I don't see the connection to
peer-to-peer.  There's no multi-function device in this picture, so
it's not about internal DMA between functions.

WDS, etc., tell us about capabilities of the controller.  If WDS is
set, the CPU (or a peer PCIe device) can write things to controller
memory.  If it is clear, neither the CPU nor a peer device can put
things there.  So it doesn't seem to tell us anything about
peer-to-peer specifically.  It looks like information needed by the
NVMe driver, but not by the PCI core.
