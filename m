Yes, we better to return -ERRNO in such case and allow callers to behave
correspondingly.

So, what I consider is to
- move inline function to be regular one
- optimize it with current dmi_get_date()
- return error code when year is not parsable
- consider current use cases where we do compare for less than a given
year

Does it sound a correct approach?

Ingo fixed that.
