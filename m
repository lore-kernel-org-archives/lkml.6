That's not all.  Making nfs4blocklayout_register_sb() immediately fail
(without doing anything) leads to that oops on the very first attempt
to mount rpc_pipefs.

Matter of fact, rpc_gssd_dummy_depopulate() is garbage.  I don't know
how it had been tested, but it will do an extra dput() of gssd_dentry
whenever it's called.  _Any_ failure that sends us to err_depopulate:
(== any failure in rpc_pipefs_notifier_list callbacks) means an oops
there on attempt to dput() an already freed dentry.

Hell, turn that if (err) goto err_depopulate; into
if (err || !strcmp(current->comm, "bugger")) goto err_depopulate;
cp /bin/mount /root/bugger, then boot with init=/bin/sh
and
cd /root; ./bugger -t rpc_pipefs none /mnt
will trigger just that.
