I understand the kmem cases which are definitely problematic and should
be fixed. IIRC there is a mechanism to custom init pages allocated for
slab cache with a ctor function which in turn can call pgtable_page_ctor().
But destructor helper support for slab has been dropped I guess.

Using pgtable_pmd_page_ctor() during PMD level pgtable page allocation
as suggested in the patch breaks pmd_alloc_one() changes as per the
previous proposal. Hence we all would need some agreement here.

https://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg701960.html

We can still accommodate the split PMD ptlock feature in pmd_alloc_one().
A possible solution can be like this above and over the previous series.

That reaffirms the fact that pgtable_page_ctor()/dtor() are getting used
not in a consistent manner.

Are you referring to ptlock_init() --> ptlock_alloc() triggered spinlock_t
allocations with USE_SPLIT_PTE_PTLOCKS and ALLOC_SPLIT_PTLOCKS.

Okay.
