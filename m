The purpose of this serie is to activate CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK which
moves the thread_info into task_struct.

Moving thread_info into task_struct has the following advantages:
- It protects thread_info from corruption in the case of stack
overflows.
- Its address is harder to determine if stack addresses are
leaked, making a number of attacks more difficult.

Changes in v15:
 - switched patch 1 and 2.
 - resync patch 1 with linux/next. As memblock modifications are now fully merged in
 linux-mm tree, this patch voids as soon as linux-mm gets merged into powerpc/merge branch
 - Fixed build failure on 64le due to call to __save_stack_trace_tsk_reliable() (patch 5)
 - Taken the renaming of THREAD_INFO to TASK_STACK out of the preparation patch to ease review (hence new patch 6)
 - Fixed one place where r11 (physical address of stack) was used instead of r1 to locate
 thread_info, inducing a bug when switching to r2 which is virtual address of current (patch 7)
 - Keeping physical address of current in r2 until MMU translation is reactivated (patch 11)

Changes in v14 (ie since v13):
 - Added in front a fixup patch which conflicts with this serie
 - Added a patch for using try_get_task_stack()/put_task_stack() in stack walkers.
 - Fixed compilation failure in the preparation patch (by moving the modification
 of klp_init_thread_info() to the following patch)

Changes since v12:
 - Patch 1: Taken comment from Mike (re-introduced the 'panic' in case memblock allocation fails in setup_64.c
 - Patch 1: Added alloc_stack() function in setup_32.c to also panic in case of allocation failure.

Changes since v11:
 - Rebased on 81775f5563fa ("Automatic merge of branches 'master', 'next' and 'fixes' into merge")
 - Added a first patch to change memblock allocs to functions returning virtual addrs. This removes
   the memset() which were the only remaining stuff in irq_ctx_init() and exc_lvl_ctx_init() at the end.
 - dropping irq_ctx_init() and exc_lvl_ctx_init() in patch 5 (powerpc: Activate CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK)
 - A few cosmetic changes in commit log and code.

Changes since v10:
 - Rebased on 21622a0d2023 ("Automatic merge of branches 'master', 'next' and 'fixes' into merge")
  ==> Fixed conflict in setup_32.S

Changes since v9:
 - Rebased on 183cbf93be88 ("Automatic merge of branches 'master', 'next' and 'fixes' into merge")
  ==> Fixed conflict on xmon

Changes since v8:
 - Rebased on e589b79e40d9 ("Automatic merge of branches 'master', 'next' and 'fixes' into merge")
  ==> Main impact was conflicts due to commit 9a8dd708d547 ("memblock: rename memblock_alloc{_nid,_try_nid} to memblock_phys_alloc*")

Changes since v7:
 - Rebased on fb6c6ce7907d ("Automatic merge of branches 'master', 'next' and 'fixes' into merge")

Changes since v6:
 - Fixed validate_sp() to exclude NULL sp in 'regain entire stack space' patch (early crash with CONFIG_KMEMLEAK)

Changes since v5:
 - Fixed livepatch_sp setup by using end_of_stack() instead of hardcoding
 - Fixed PPC_BPF_LOAD_CPU() macro

Changes since v4:
 - Fixed a build failure on 32bits SMP when include/generated/asm-offsets.h is not
 already existing, was due to spaces instead of a tab in the Makefile

Changes since RFC v3: (based on Nick's review)
 - Renamed task_size.h to task_size_user64.h to better relate to what it contains.
 - Handling of the isolation of thread_info cpu field inside CONFIG_SMP #ifdefs moved to a separate patch.
 - Removed CURRENT_THREAD_INFO macro completely.
 - Added a guard in asm/smp.h to avoid build failure before _TASK_CPU is defined.
 - Added a patch at the end to rename 'tp' pointers to 'sp' pointers
 - Renamed 'tp' into 'sp' pointers in preparation patch when relevant
 - Fixed a few commit logs
 - Fixed checkpatch report.

Changes since RFC v2:
 - Removed the modification of names in asm-offsets
 - Created a rule in arch/powerpc/Makefile to append the offset of current->cpu in CFLAGS
 - Modified asm/smp.h to use the offset set in CFLAGS
 - Squashed the renaming of THREAD_INFO to TASK_STACK in the preparation patch
 - Moved the modification of current_pt_regs in the patch activating CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK

Changes since RFC v1:
 - Removed the first patch which was modifying header inclusion order in timer
 - Modified some names in asm-offsets to avoid conflicts when including asm-offsets in C files
 - Modified asm/smp.h to avoid having to include linux/sched.h (using asm-offsets instead)
 - Moved some changes from the activation patch to the preparation patch.
