Dude, turn on brain!

So if it is in the other CPER code, we should copy it, no matter how
dumb it is?!?

We need to have a way to map the GUID to a hw part. Dumb numbers mean shit
because the error record is worthless.

Again, those numbers can't help decoding the error, no need to dump
them. Or we find a way to make sense out of that info.

If the structs are the same, you can use generic functions for dumping -
the offsets are meaningless then.
