According to Murphy's law this is inevitable..

I've seen couple division by zero crashes in bfq_wr_duration.
Unfortunately logs weren't recorded.

Or am I missing something else?
 >>> +	bfqd->peak_rate = clamp_t(u64, rate + bfqd->peak_rate, 1, U32_MAX);

32-bit should be enough and better for division.
My patch makes sure it never overflows/underflows.
That's cheaper than full 64-bit/64-bit division.
Anyway 64-bit speed could overflow too. =)
