Target doesn't crash but the errors on the initiator are still there.

Seems that if I do large transfers, I see this in the initiator's logs.
With the previous patch, I burned 3 dvds at the same time, compared the
files to the originals and I have a script that catalogs the files.  The
files consist of debian packages and source files.  The 3 operations did not
show any errors in the kernel log on either end.

I did this test:
initiator: dd if=/dev/sr1 bs=512k count=1024 | md5sum
target:    dd if=/dev/sr0 bs=512k count=1024 | md5sum

Result: the same.  It's OK even with the i/o errors shown on the initiator.

The above patch was added on top of the one you gave me before, but I don't
believe that that would be an issue.

...  Now if someone could help me with a kvm virtualization problem I'm
having with 4.16 that wasn't there with 4.15...
