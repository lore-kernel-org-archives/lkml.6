Actually shim is EFI specific but not x86 specific. I agree with you that
not all system has shim. But at least shim provides a way to interact with
user to detect the physical accessing.

For the system doesn't have shim, kernel can provide a boot option for user
to trust the keys in DB. But it also means that the boot option can be
enabled without physical accessing.

Could you please provide more detail for those methods? Thanks!

It's not the best solution because it relies on other layers. But it's
currently the only solution for general EFI firmware. Or you have other
solution can be used for all architectures?

Thanks a lot!
