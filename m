'managed' irq's affinity is managed by kernel, and user space can't change
it any more via /proc/irq/...

That is one nice question.

So far there are at least two rules related with correctness:

1) 'is_managed' flag needs to be set

2) for all managed irq vectors in one interrupt set of one device,
all possible CPUs should be covered in the setup affinities, meantime
one CPU can't be allocated to two irq vectors. The interrupt set is
unique for NVMe actually now, such as, all READ queues' interrupts
belong to one set, and other queues belong to another set. For other
device, we can think there is only one set for one device.

So far the default affinity for pre_vectors & post_vectors is to use
irq_default_affinity, and this patch changes it to cpu_possible_mask,
and this change won't be one big deal from driver's view.

Yeah, together with simplification in both driver and genirq/affinity
code.

Please see above, and I plan to enhance the rule in genirq/affinity code
if this approach may be accepted.

Thanks,
