The advantage of having two ioctls is that they can both pass (meta-)data
bidirectionally. That is hard to do with standard read() and write() calls.
The command tag is the piece if meta-data that goes against the flow:
returned from SG_IOSUBMIT, optionally given to SG_IORECEIVE (which might have
a 'cancel command' flag).

The sg v1, v2 and v3 interfaces could keep their write()/read() interfaces
for backward compatibility (to Linux 1.0.0, March 1994 for sg v1). New, clean
submit and receive paths could be added to the sg driver for the v3 and
v4 twin ioctl interface. Previously the sg v4 interface was only supported
by the bsg driver. One advantage of sg v4 over v3 is support for bidi
commands. Not sure if epoll/poll works with an ioctl, if not we could add a
"dummy" read() call that notionally returned SCSI status. The SG_IORECEIVE
ioctl would still be needed to "clean up" the command, and optionally
transfer the data-in buffer.

Tony Battersby has also requested twin ioctls saying that it is extremely
tedious ploughing through logs full of SG_IO calls and that clearly
separating submits from receives would make things somewhat better.
