That's not quite fair.  Generic code isn't always universally
applicable; some of it is opt-in -- meant only for the architectures
that can support it.  In general, the LKMM allows us to reason about
higher abstractions (such as locking) at a higher level, without
necessarily being able to verify the architecture-specific details of
the implementations.

Currently the LKMM does not permit architecture-specific reasoning.  It 
would have to be extended (in a different way for each architecture) 
first.

For example, one could use herd's POWER model combined with the POWER 
compilation scheme and the POWER-specific implementation of spinlocks 
for such reasoning.  The LKMM alone is not sufficient.

Sure, programming and reasoning about the kernel would be easier if all
architectures were the same.  Unfortunately, we (and the kernel) have
to live in the real world.

But are these building blocks used the same way for all architectures?
