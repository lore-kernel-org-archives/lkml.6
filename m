Yes and no. We cannot revert if both cases are in use, but we can
support both cases; add the .local file, or - for binary compatibility
- add the compat mount flag to switch to the old behavior.

In the vmalloc and the zonelist_order_zone cases above, any users that
would rely on those features would have to blacklist certain kernel
versions in which they are not available.

In this case, any users that rely on the old behavior would have to
mount cgroup2 with the compat knob.

Arguably, it's easier to pass a mount option than it is to change the
entire kernel.

Of course, but that's where the "which situation is more likely" comes
in. That was the basis for all the historic changes I quoted above.

Thanks.
