Hm, I thought I had already written a mail, but apparently I didn't....

My view is the following:
- select is useful for library functionality or for enabling
  architecture-specific optimizations (the HAVE_xxx symbols),
  especially things you don't want the user to deal with. If you select
  something, you need to take care of any dependencies yourself.
- depends is useful for more complex dependencies, and especially
  things you don't want automagically enabled. [In modern menuconfig,
  it is easy to figure out any missing dependencies for a config option
  anyway.]

The mdev infrastructure is too complex to be considered a simple
library IMO (cf. the missing VFIO dependency).
