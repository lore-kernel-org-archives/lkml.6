Can you expand on your reasoning here?

Playing devil's advocate:

If the library is just exposing the syscall interface, I don't see
why it _couldn't_ fit into the vdso (or something vdso-like).

If a separate library, I'd be concerned that it would accumulate
value-add bloat over time, and the kernel ABI may start to creep since
most software wouldn't invoke the kernel directly any more.  Even if
it's maintained in the kernel tree, its existence as an apparently
standalone component may encourage forking, leading to a potential
compatibility mess.

The vdso approach would mean we can guarantee that the library is
available and up to date at runtime, and may make it easier to keep
what's in it down to sane essentials.

Cheers
