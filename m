For mmc0 at least typically the supply is on the PMIC for omap
variants and it's controlled over i2c or spi bus like most other
regulators. Then boards some have additional GPIO controlled
regulators. So yeah some kind of locking issue between two or
more regulators on i2c or spi bus could be the reason.
