Thanks for your patch!

With the default of 512, that's a memset of 128 bytes. Not so insignificant
on embedded 32 bit.

I think you need a range here.  Else someone will pick a too large value,
causing stack overflow.

512 (128 bytes for each recursion level) sounds like a safe maximum to me.

The fast path doesn't use a statically allocated buffer (it cannot, due to
recursion), but a buffer on the stack. I think you need to make that very
clear in the help text, as this has the potential of causing random crashes.

The assignment to bits could be made common, and moved out of the if/else.

Likewise for the memset, which means you would usually clear a single word
again, instead of 128 bytes (or more).
