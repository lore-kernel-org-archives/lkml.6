Actually, after reading a recent QoS related bug report, I realised that
a resume latency request of "n/a" is actually a third way of disabling
runtime PM, which similarly to the negative autosuspend would prevent
also a closed port from suspending.

Using a small positive resume latency for this feels like too much of a
hack, but defining a new QoS flag might still work.
