PAGE_SIZE is usually defined as 1 << PAGE_SHIFT. So I think PAGE_SHIFT 
is actually more appropriate here.

I'm okay either way. If adding an extra comma is preferred by many 
people, someone should update checkpatch.pl to enforce it. :)

No sure what exactly degradation is caused by vzalloc here. I think it's 
better to keep physically contiguous pages
to other requests which really need them. Besides slow path/mem 
compacting can be really expensive.
