Thanks!

According to the log, we are now using 400KHz as the init frequency,
because we succeeds to initialize the SDIO card already at the first
attempt. The same thing happens to Anders' new tests.

Conclusion from my side: We need the delay, probably because the
internals of the WiFi chip isn't ready as soon as the WiFi spec
states. In either case, I suggest you to re-spin your patch [1] and
extend to delay to 10ms (instead of 1ms, just to be safe). Let it have
also have the below fixes tag (as it seems like an original problem
with the pwrseq) and also tag it for stable.

Fixes: ea452678734e ("arm64: dts: hikey: Fix WiFi support")

Finally, feel free to add my ack for it.

Kind regards
Uffe
