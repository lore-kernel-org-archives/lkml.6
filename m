What PCIe feature does this depend on?

I see the PCIe test in pci_bridge_d3_possible(), added by 9d26d3a8f1b0
("PCI: Put PCIe ports into D3 during suspend"), but unfortunately that
commit doesn't say *why* we only do this for PCIe, or only for BIOS
dates of 2015 or newer.

George, can you find out which specific devices are involved here?

My working assumption is that as for_each_pci_dev() iterates through
all the devices, we call pci_probe_reset_function() for a root port
that happens to be in D3hot (this should work fine because the root
port's config space should be accessible), then we call
pci_probe_reset_function() for a device *below* the root port.  That
doesn't work because the root port's link is down and and devices
below it are not accessible.  The root port should treat this as an
Unsupported Request.

How do we identify the places that need to call pm_runtime_get_sync()?

PCI devices will respond to config accesses while in D3hot, but not to
memory or I/O accesses.  I think that distinction is probably too
detailed and the general rule should be "the device must be in D0
before you access it."

I guess generally the driver is in control, and if it suspends the
device, it has to be smart enough to resume it before touching it.

This particular pci_probe_reset_function() case is a problem because
it's the PCI *core* doing the access while the device may already be
claimed by a driver.  I think it's generally taboo for the core to do
this, and I have a patch to move this access so it happens before a
driver can claim the device.

We also have the case where userspace accesses a device via sysfs.  I
guess all those cases probably need to wake up the device.  It looks
like pci_config_pm_runtime_get() already does that for config
accesses.

But I think other entry points, e.g., the following, should have the
same problem and I don't see anything there:

  pci_read_legacy_io()
  pci_write_legacy_io()
  pci_mmap_legacy_mem()
  pci_mmap_legacy_io()
  pci_mmap_resource()
  pci_resource_io()
  pci_read_rom()
  reset_store()

Plus probably the ASPM control files, VPD, maybe others?
