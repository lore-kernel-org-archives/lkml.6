The RPi3 is known to not work with some SD cards. You can find some
wiki pages with large tables of known-working and known-broken cards. I
have a couple of RPi3 boards and a card that works and card that does
not. I tried debugging the issue but did not find anything I can do
about it - AFAICT the issue happens somewhere inside the MMC controller
IP. 

I have no inside knowledge of the controller in question but during
testing I tried to reset the controller whenever the issue happens so I
can continue running the test system for a longer time until it gets
unusable. While I did not find any solution to the problem the
workaround with resetting the controller works quite reliably for me.

So I am posting it in the hope that people with the wrong combination
of RPi3 and SD card will not get a blank screen but rather a system
that boots but tends to lock up for half a minute occasionally.

Thanks

Michal
