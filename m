Unfortunately it is a customer workload that they guard closely and wouldn't let us
look at the source code.  We have to profile and backtrace its behavior.

Mel made a quick attempt to reproduce the behavior with a hot page migration, 
but he wasn't quite able to duplicate the pathologic behavior.

In certain cases if we have lots of pages sharing a page wait queue,
your solution would help, and we wouldn't be wasting time checking
waiters not waiting on the page that's being unlocked.  Though I
don't have a specific workload that has such behavior.

The goal to migrate a hot page with care, or avoid bouncing it around 
frequently makes sense.  If it is a hot page shared by many threads
running on different NUMA nodes, and moving it will only mildly improve NUMA
locality, we should avoid the migration.
