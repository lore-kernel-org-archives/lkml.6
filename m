Hi All,

The AmigaOne X1000 doesn’t boot anymore since the PCI updates. I have seen, that the PCI updates are different to the updates below. The code below works but the latest not. Is there a problem with the latest PCI updates currently?

Thanks,
Christian

PCIe Downstream Ports normally have only a Device 0 below them.  To
optimize enumeration, we don't scan for other devices *unless* the
PCI_SCAN_ALL_PCIE_DEVS flag is set by set by quirks or the
"pci=pcie_scan_all" kernel parameter.

Previously PCI_SCAN_ALL_PCIE_DEVS only affected scanning below Switch
Downstream Ports, not Root Ports.

But the "Nemo" system, also known as the AmigaOne X1000, has a PA Semi Root
Port whose link leads to an AMD/ATI SB600 South Bridge.  The Root Port is a
PCIe device, of course, but the SB600 contains only conventional PCI
devices with no visible PCIe port.

Simplify and restructure only_one_child() so that we scan for all possible
devices below Root Ports as well as Switch Downstream Ports when
PCI_SCAN_ALL_PCIE_DEVS is set.

This is enough to make Nemo work with "pci=pcie_scan_all".  We would also
like to add a quirk to set PCI_SCAN_ALL_PCIE_DEVS automatically on Nemo so
users wouldn't have to use the "pci=pcie_scan_all" parameter, but we don't
have that yet.

Applied to pci/enumeration for v4.16.
