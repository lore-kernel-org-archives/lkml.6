The whole point of fuzzing is to provide improper inputs.  A kernel bug is a
kernel bug, even if it's in deprecated/unmaintained code, or involves userspace
doing something unexpected.  If you have known buggy code in XFS that you refuse
to fix, then please provide a kernel config option so that users can disable the
unmaintained XFS formats/features, leaving the maintained ones.  As-is, you seem
to be forcing everyone who enables CONFIG_XFS_FS to build known
buggy/unmaintained code into their kernel.
