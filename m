Having worked on ixgbe a bit, I have to wonder what kind of havoc would ensue if an ixgbe device were assigned to a guest, and an attempt was made to allocate VFs by the pci-stub. The guest could be running any version of the ixgbe driver, possibly even an old one that didn't support SR-IOV. Even if it did support SR-IOV, I don't know how it would respond to mailbox messages when it doesn't think it has VFs.

There are tools that let non-root users load the stub.

People use that to e.g.  prevent a native driver from loading while also
assuming it won't break the kernel.

I'm not sure how a global option can work for use-cases
such as containers though.
