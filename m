One thing to note here is that it is not generally possible to inhibit
all absolute references, given that statically initialized pointer
variables will result in R_AARCH64_ABS64 relocations in any case. So
what we are after (and we should align this with the GCC team as well)
is a code model option or some other flag that prevents the compiler
from *generating code* that relies on absolute addressing, given that
we have no control over this (whereas it is feasible to avoid
statically initialized pointer variables in code that is expected to
execute at a memory offset that is different from the kernel's runtime
memory offset)
