Descriptions of metrics for POWER9 processors can be found in the
"POWER9 Performance Monitor Unit User’s Guide", which is currently
available on the "IBM Portal for OpenPOWER"
(https://www-355.ibm.com/systems/power/openpower/welcome.xhtml) at
https://www-355.ibm.com/systems/power/openpower/posting.xhtml?postingId=4948CDE1963C9BCA852582F800718190

This patch is for metric groups:
- cpi_breakdown
- estimated_dcache_miss_cpi
