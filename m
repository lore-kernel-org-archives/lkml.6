Interesting that it needs much longer delay here compared to the
earlier?

BTW, I do have a patch in work to add pwrseq support for wlcore that
allows leaving out the regulator here. It still needs a bit more
work though.

And I also have a series in work to make wlcore use runtime PM that
needs even more work, just FYI to avoid any duplicate work.

Hmm you don't happen to have a patch series somewhere making
wlcore use the SDIO dat lien interrupt?

I think we should use that when idle rather than the (edge) gpio
interrupt as the SDIO dat interrupt is level sensitive and wired
to the always on gpio bank for most SDIO controller instances.
On runtime PM wakeup, there's no status anywhere to been with the
GPIO edge interrupt.

Regards,

Tony
