There was a considerable amount of work and discussion on implementing
Stream IDs for the block layer.  This would annotate writes from =
userspace
and allow the underlying storage (filesystem and block layer) to use the
stream ID for block allocation.  See the following for more details:

    https://lwn.net/Articles/717755/
    https://lwn.net/Articles/726477/
    =
http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-nvme/2017-June/011322.html

In the absence of other information, the Stream ID would just mean =
"group
allocations with the same ID together". After some discussion, it looks
like the latest patch has generic "lifetime" hints rather than "stream =
IDs",
but the end result is largely the same.

It would make sense for you to spend time testing and fixing that patch
series instead of trying to introduce a new interface.  IMHO, there is
no need to make these hints persistent on disk, since their state could
be inferred by the allocation placement directly.

Cheers, Andreas
