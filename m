Hello Bob,

There is both a V2 and V3 of this patchset, V3 moves this to a sdio.c and
calls ath10k_mac_tx_push_pending() unconditionally.


But to answer your question,
it shouldn't matter if the read is done while holding the lock or not.

Sure, the compiler could do things so that the code path is always or never
executed, but that is why I added READ_ONCE() in V2.

A spin lock does have the advantage of ordering: memory operations issued
before the spin_unlock_bh() will be completed before the spin_unlock_bh()
operation has completed.

However, ath10k_htt_tx_dec_pending() was called earlier in the same function,
which decreases htt->num_pending_tx, so that write will be completed before
our read. That is the only ordering we care about here (if we should call
ath10k_mac_tx_push_pending() or not).


Kind regards,
Niklas
