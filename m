OK so that seems to be related to the last patch. I've applied
the first two defconfig patches into omap-for-v4.17/defconfig
and patches up to patch 13/15 into omap-for-v4.17/dt-sdhci.

Kishon, please repost the missing changes or ping me when
the driver dependencies have cleared for further patches to
be applied to enable sdhci.

Regards,

Tony
