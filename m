Hmm what's odd about it? We need to describe the behaviour is all cases.

This has been discussed ad nauseum. virtio is all about compatibility.
Losing a couple of lines of code isn't worth breaking working setups.
People that want "just use DMA API no tricks" now have the option.
Setting a flag in a feature bit map is literally a single line
of code in the hypervisor. So stop pushing for breaking working
legacy setups and just fix it in the right place.
