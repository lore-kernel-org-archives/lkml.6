Agreed on the general idea: a process should be able to pass tagged pointers at the 
syscall interface, as long as they point to memory privately owned by the process. I 
think it would be possible to simplify the definition of "non-weird" memory by using 
only this "OK" list:
- mmap() done by the process itself, where either:
   * flags = MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS
   * flags = MAP_PRIVATE and fd refers to a regular file or a well-defined list of 
device files (like /dev/zero)
- brk() done by the process itself
- Any memory mapped by the kernel in the new process's address space during execve(), 
with the same restrictions as above ([vdso]/[vvar] are therefore excluded)

To some extent, one could call me a userspace developer, so I'll try to help :)

>   * Userspace should set tags at the point of allocation only.

Yes, tags are only supposed to be set at the point of either allocation or 
deallocation/reallocation. However, allocators can in principle be nested, so an 
allocator could  take a region allocated by malloc() as input and subdivide it 
(changing tags in the process). That said, this suballocator must not free() that 
region until all the suballocations themselves have been freed (thereby restoring the 
tags initially set by malloc()).

Agreed, allocators that tag memory can only operate on memory with a well-defined 
provenance (for instance anonymous mmap() or malloc()).

Agreed. Allocators themselves may need to be excluded though, depending on how they 
represent their managed memory.

Tags can only be changed at the point of deallocation/reallocation. Pointers to the 
object become invalid and cannot be used after it has been deallocated; memory 
tagging allows to catch such invalid usage.

I think both points are reasonable. It is very valuable for the kernel to access 
userspace memory using the user-provided tag, because it enables kernel accesses to 
be checked in the same way as user accesses, allowing to detect bugs that are 
potentially hard to find. For instance, if a pointer to an object is passed to the 
kernel after it has been deallocated, this is invalid and should be detected. 
However, you are absolutely right that the kernel cannot *guarantee* that such a 
check is carried out for the entire memory range (or in fact at all); it should be a 
best-effort approach.

Do you have any particular case in mind? If such caching is really valuable, it is 
always possible to access the object while ignoring the tag. For sure, the 
user-provided tag can only be used during the syscall handling itself, not 
asynchronously later on, unless otherwise specified.

This is a disputed point :) In my opinion, this is the the most reasonable approach.
