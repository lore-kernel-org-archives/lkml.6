Which device are you talking about?  The one that signals wakeup?  If
so, then I beg to differ.

On ACPI platforms WAKE# is represented as an ACPI GPE that is signaled
through SCI and handled at a different level (on HW-reduced ACPI it
actually can be a GPIO interrupt, but it still is handled with the
help of AML).  The driver of the device signaling wakeup need not even
be aware that WAKE# has been asserted.

WAKE# is a signal that is converted into an interrupt, but that
interrupt may arrive at some place your driver has nothing to do with.
It generally doesn't make sense to represent it as an interrupt for
the target device.
