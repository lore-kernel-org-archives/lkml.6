Need to clarify the "clearing out", I think it was meant differently.
It was more about on how to ensure that the 16-bytes long of the v3
supplied to a v1-only kernel is compatible with the 12-bytes long v1.
The kernel would have to check the trailing 4 bytes after v1-size and
make sure they are all zeroed in order for the old kernel to accept it
as a v1. But, as I said above, there are situations that this will not
be enough.

We have issues on read path too. 52ccb8e90c0a ("[SCTP]: Update
SCTP_PEER_ADDR_PARAMS socket option to the latest api draft.")
extended struct sctp_paddrparams and its getsockopt goes with:

sctp_getsockopt_peer_addr_params()
...
        if (len < sizeof(struct sctp_paddrparams))
                return -EINVAL;
        len = sizeof(struct sctp_paddrparams);

By then, we didn't have the /uapi/ folder yet. There may other cases.
