This is true only for vma that are not mmap of a device file. This is
what i was trying to get accross. An mmap of a file is never merge
so it can only get split/butcher by munmap/mremap but when that happen
you also need to reflect the virtual address space change to the
device ie any access to a now invalid range must trigger error.

Yes the HMM does deal with this for you, you do not have to worry about
it. Sorry if that was not clear. I just wanted to stress that vma that
are mmap of a file do not behave like other vma hence when you create
the UMEM you can check for those if you feel the need.
