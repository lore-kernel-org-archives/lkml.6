Please note these aliases become cumbersome once you start considering
(dynamic) DT overlays.  That's why I made them optional in the sh-sci
serial driver, cfr. commit 7678f4c20fa7670f ("serial: sh-sci: Add support
for dynamic instances").
Relevant parts of the commit description are:

    On DT platforms, the sh-sci driver requires the presence of "serialN"
    aliases in DT, from which instance IDs are derived.  If a DT alias is
    missing, the drivers fails to probe the corresponding serial port.

    This becomes cumbersome when considering DT overlays, as currently
    there is no upstream support for dynamically updating the /aliases node
    in DT.  Furthermore, even in the presence of such support, hardcoded
    instance IDs in independent overlays are prone to conflicts.

    Hence add support for dynamic instance IDs, to be used in the absence of
    a DT alias.  This makes serial ports behave similar to I2C and SPI
    buses, which already support dynamic instances.

To clarify my point: R-Car M2-W has 4 different types of serial ports, for a
total of 18 ports, and the two ports on a board labeled 0 and 1 may not
correspond to the physical first two ports (what's "first" in a collection of
4 different types?).

Aliases may be fine for referring to the main serial console (labeled
port 0 on the device, too), and the primary Ethernet interface (so U-Boot
knows where to add the "local-mac-address" property), but beyond that,
I think they should be avoided.

Just my two^H^H^Hfive €c.
