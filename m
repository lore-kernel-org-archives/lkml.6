Yes, that's right.  This shows how P5's Ra must obtain 2 instead of 0.

They do, but the other effects are irrelevant for this proof.

You have misunderstood the naming scheme.  mb05 is the barrier injected 
by P0's sys_membarrier call into P5.  So the three barriers above 
should be named "mb03", "mb04", and "mb05".  And you left out mb01 and 
mb02.

Yes, this does hold.  But since it doesn't affect the end result, 
there's no point in mentioning all those other barriers.

No, it wouldn't.  I don't understand why you might think it would.  

This is just like RCU, if you imagine a tiny critical section between 
each adjacent pair of instructions.  You wouldn't expect RCU to enforce 
ordering among six CPUs with only one synchronize_rcu call.

Yes it could.  But even in this execution you would end up with Ra=2 
instead of Ra=0.
