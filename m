Sure. I cut it here because I didn't expect people to debug what is
already known to be broken (but still it seemed to carry useful
information about the hw). :)

I see. Just wondering why even if Broadcom's STA solution seems to work
fine, it is not mainline. Maybe a maintenance problem? But Fedora ships
with very recent kernels, so I'd expect the driver to work with mainline
(I tried compiling that against mainline, but I got errors that I didn't
spend time figuring out how to fix).

Do you know what's the deal w.r.t. the STA driver?

Best,
