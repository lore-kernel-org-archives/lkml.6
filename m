What if we took rename_lock (call it nd->r_seq) at the start of the
resolution, and then only tried the __d_path-style check

  if (read_seqretry(&rename_lock, nd->r_seq) ||
      read_seqretry(&mount_lock, nd->m_seq))
	  /* do the __d_path lookup. */

That way you would only hit the slow path if there were concurrent
renames or mounts *and* you are doing a path resolution with
AT_THIS_ROOT or AT_BENEATH. I've attached a modified patch that does
this (and after some testing it also appears to work).

I'm not sure if there's a way to always avoid the quadratic lookup
without (significantly and probably unreasonably) changing how dcache
invalidation works. And obviously using this slow path if there was
_any_ rename on the _entire_ system is suboptimal, but I think it is a
significant improvement.

Another possibility is to expand on Andy's suggestion to use
/proc/$pid/root, and instead require AT_THIS_ROOT to use the root of a
namespace as its dirfd (I'm not sure if there's a trivial way to detect
this though). This wouldn't help with AT_BENEATH, but it should protect
against ".." shenanigans without any ".." handling changes. (This is
less ideal because it requires a container process, but it is another
way of dealing with the issue.)
