It seems to me that the serialized reset works for multiple resets of the
same device, doesn't it? Our problem is linked to resets of different devices
that share the same PCIe tree.

You're right that the problem we face might also come with manual resets
under certain conditions (I think that all devices in a subtree would need
to be disabled).
