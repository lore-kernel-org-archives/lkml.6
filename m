I wonder if Rolf posted the wrong version accidentally, since he
mentioned making these match, but I don't see anything different in
this posting.  Oh, never mind, I see the response about rebasing.
I should have been more clear about what I was looking for.

Also s/epf/EPF/, since "epf" isn't a real word.
