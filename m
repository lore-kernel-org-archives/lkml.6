Its because the order was established a long time ago. User space tools still 
expect that ordering.

Hmm. I see. If that event was ever sent to linux-audit mail list for 
feedback, we would have had some discussion because it's not a proper event. 
The order of the fields changed, new fields were added, untrusted string 
logging is being used, field names are not documented in the field name 
dictionary, existing field names are not being used, subject information is 
incomplete, results is missing, and its not entirely clear what the object 
is.
