I was comparing how other end device driver's enable this, and they all call
pci_enable_pcie_error_reporting() somewhere along their pci_driver->probe
path. With that in mind, are ports special compared to end devices for this
particular feature?

There are unfortunately still pci_driver instances that don't implement
the err_handler callbacks, and may cause problems if we enable error
reporting in the device when its driver isn't capable of reacting to them.

If it wasn't for that, I think it would make more sense to move this
responsibility from drivers to the pci core.

Right, but that's no different than every other Linux pci_driver. The
component that provides the pci_driver.err_handler should be responsible
for requesting to enable device error reporting, and that's provided by
the port driver, not AER.
