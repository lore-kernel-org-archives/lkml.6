For HMM P2P mapping we need to call into the driver to know if driver
wants to fallback to main memory (running out of BAR addresses) or if
it can allow a peer device to directly access its memory. We also need
the call to exporting device driver as only the exporting device driver
can map the HMM page pfn to some physical BAR address (which would be
allocated by driver for GPU).

I wanted to make sure the HMM case was understood too, sorry if it
caused confusion with the non HMM case which i describe below.

So when you are not using HMM ie existing GPU object without HMM then
like i said you do not have any valid pte most of the time inside the
CPU page table ie the GPU driver only populate the pte with valid
entry when they are CPU page fault and it clear those as soon as the
corresponding object is use by the GPU. In fact some driver also unmap
it agressively from the BAR making the memory totaly un-accessible to
anything but the GPU.

GPU driver do not like CPU mapping, they are quite aggressive about
clearing them. Then everything i said about having userspace deciding
which object can be share, and, with who, do apply here. So for GPU you
do want to give control to GPU driver and you do not want to require valid
CPU pte for the vma so that the exporting driver can return valid
address to the importing peer device only.

Also exporting device driver might decide to fallback to main memory
(running out of BAR addresses for instance). So again here we want to
go through the exporting device driver so that it can take the right
action.

So the expected pattern (for GPU driver) is:
    - no valid pte for the special vma (mmap of device file)
    - importing device call p2p_map() for the vma if it succeed the
      first time then we expect it will succeed for the same vma and
      range next time we call it.
    - exporting driver can either return physical address to page
      into its BAR space that point to the correct device memory or
      fallback to main memory

Then at any point in time:
    - if GPU driver want to move the object around (for whatever
      reasons) it calls zap_vma_ptes() the fact that there is no
      valid CPU pte does not matter it will call mmu notifier and thus
      any importing device driver will invalidate its mapping
    - importing device driver that lost the mapping due to mmu
      notification can re-map by re-calling p2p_map() (it should
      check that the vma is still valid ...) and guideline is for
      the exporting device driver to succeed and return valid
      address to the new memory use for the object

This allow device driver like GPU to keep control. The expected
pattern is still the p2p mapping to stay undisrupted for their
whole lifetime. Invalidation should only be triggered if GPU driver
do need to move things around.

All the above is for the no HMM case ie mmap of a device file so
for any existing open source GPU device driver that do not support
HMM.

Cheers,
Jérôme
