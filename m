First off, you did your testing with Tumbleweed image which probably
uses btrfs for / while I use Leap 42.3 image which uses ext4.

I was not able to reproduce the issue with installing packages so far -
installed GNOME which is over 700 packages and the issue did not
trigger. However, the upgrades also unlink the old files as does
removing packages - removing GNOME removed over 200 packages and the
issue triggered. However, re-installing and removing GNOME again did
not trigger the issue. So nothing so far reproduces the issue reliably.
With the new kernel the issue even reproduces less frequently than the
4.4 and 4.15 kernel - probably some i/o scheduler change affects the
disk i/o patterns.

Thanks

Michal
