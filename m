Yeah, it was just a quick hack to look for stuff.

But it encourages misuse with calloc(N * M, gfp) ... if we removed
calloc and kept k[mz]alloc_something(gfp, a, b, c...) I think we'd
have better adoption.

Yes, quite so. It's really why I went with kmalloc_array_3d(), but now
I'm thinking better of it...

Yup, quite true. Obviously not the final form. ;) I meant to
illustrate that we could do compile-time tricks to reorder the
division in an efficient manner.

On the CPU it's not retained across multiple calculations. And the
type matters too. This came up recently in a separate thread too:

Right, it wasn't meant to be exhaustive. I just included it in case
anyone wanted to go grepping around for themselves.
