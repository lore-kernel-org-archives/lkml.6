I'd suggest giving an explicit advisory comment to clarify and suggest
correct usage:

"This would typically require either that you obtained the node from a
previous walk of the list in the same RCU read-side critical section, or
that you held some sort of non-RCU reference (such as a reference count)
to keep the node alive *and* in the list."

(Feel free to wordsmith the exact wording, but something like that seems
like it would help people understand how to use this correctly, and make
it less likely that they'd use it incorrectly.)
