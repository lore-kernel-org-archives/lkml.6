FWIW, here's some of the discussion related to hfi1 from [1]:

  The device comes out of reset at the 5GT/s speed. The driver
  downloads device firmware, programs PCIe registers, and co-ordinates
  the transition to 8GT/s.

  This recipe is device specific and is therefore implemented in the
  hfi1 driver built on top of PCI core functions and macros.

Also several DRM drivers seem to do this (see cik_pcie_gen3_enable(),
si_pcie_gen3_enable()); from [2]:

  My understanding was that some platfoms only bring up the link in gen 1
  mode for compatibility reasons.

Yeah, it's probably OK.  I don't want bug reports from people who
think something's broken when it's really just a hardware limitation
of their system.  But hopefully the message is not alarming.

I'm not sure what you think I'm thinking :)  My question is whether
it's worthwhile to print this extra information for *every* PCIe
device, given that your use case is the tiny percentage of broken
systems.

If we only printed the info in the "bw_avail < bw_cap" case, i.e.,
when the device is capable of more than it's getting, that would make
a lot of sense to me.  The normal case line is more questionable.  I
think the reason that's there is because the network drivers are very
performance sensitive and like to see that info all the time.

Maybe we need something like this:

  pcie_print_link_status(struct pci_dev *dev, int verbose)
  {
    ...
    if (bw_avail >= bw_cap) {
      if (verbose)
        pci_info(dev, "... available PCIe bandwidth ...");
    } else
      pci_info(dev, "... available PCIe bandwidth, limited by ...");
  }

So the core could print only the potential problems with:

  pcie_print_link_status(dev, 0);

and drivers that really care even if there's no problem could do:

  pcie_print_link_status(dev, 1);

OK, I think I see your point: if the upstream port *could* do 16x but
only trains to 4x, and two endpoints below it are both capable of 4x,
the endpoints *think* they're happy but in fact they have to share 4x
when they could use more.
