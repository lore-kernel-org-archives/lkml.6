One ugly solution could be
to add one more CC_HAS_ for the combination of the two ?


# If two compiler flags interact, the combination should be checked.
# Hopefully, we do not have many cases like this...
config CC_HAS_STACKPROTECTOR_WITH_RETPOLINE
       option cc_option "-fstackprotector  -mindirect-branch=thunk-extern"

I was thinking of removing CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILE.

A user can dynamically change CROSS_COMPILE from
"make menuconfig".

If we continue to support this, $CC changes
according to CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILE.
Then, compiler flags must be re-evaluated
every time a user changes a compiler in use.
It will introduce much more complexity.

The easiest way would be to import $CC from environment
and fix the compiler capability before loading Kconfig.

As Ulf explained, this does not happen.

include/config/auto.conf and include/generated/autoconf.h
are the mirror of the .config.

If .config is updated, silentoldconfig is invoked to sync them.
