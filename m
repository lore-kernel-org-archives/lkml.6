AFAICT, the only way this can happen is that if the inode ->i_mode
has been corrupted in some way. i.e. there is either on-disk or
in-memory corruption occurring.

No, it doesn't make sense because a newly allocated inode should
always have a zero i_mode.

Have you turned on memory poisoning to try to identify where the
corruption is coming from?

And given that it might actually be on-disk corruption that is
causing this, have you run xfs_repair on these filesystems to
determine if they are free from on-disk corruption?

Indeed, that makes me wonder format are you running on these
filesystems, because on the more recent v5 format we don't read
newly allocated inodes from disk. Can you provide the info listed
here:

http://xfs.org/index.php/XFS_FAQ#Q:_What_information_should_I_include_when_reporting_a_problem.3F

as that will tell us what code paths are executing on inode
allocation.

Cheers,

Dave.
