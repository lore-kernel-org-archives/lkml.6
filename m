In your next patches please Cc the folks I added for future review as well.
We don't have a mailing list for the firmware API so I just tend to Cc
who I think should help review when needed.

It varies, sometimes firmware has default fluff calibration data as well which 
can be used if the device does not have specific calibration data.

BTW do these cheap x86 devices have hw signing support? Just curious thinking
long term here. Because of it is not-standard then perhaps wen can partner
later up with a vendor to this properly and actually support hw firmware
singing.

Sneaky Pete, nice. So essentially we're reverse engineering support for this.

Anyway please mention that this is not part of standard in the documentation,
and we've just found out in practice some vendors are doing this. That would
avoid having people ask later.

Neat, best to add proper docs for this.

Absolutely, just not to shove an entire fallback firmware path to all users.

The firmware API is even used to load microcode, but that relies on built-in
firmware support. That code needs to be refactored to be a proper citizen of the
firmware API, right now its just a hack. Reason for asking all these details
was to ensure we document the restrictions correctly so that expecations are
set correctly for callers prior to rest_init(). Please be sure to document the
limitations.

Sure but did you poke ARM folks about it? Maybe they can do it?
And if this becomes a common practice, perhaps they can do it with
actual firmware signing instead of a CRC.

Not sure how hard it is to exploit EFI_BOOT_SERVICES_CODE... but it
may help UEFI folks with a nice warm fuzzy to start doing this right
later instead of propagating what seems to be a cheap hack.

The fallback mechanism / code has been a maintainer irritation for a long time now,
to verify its functionality, document it, and ensure folks understand how things
work. Best to be clear and simple about this functionality, adding more extensions
without any need just makes things more complex.

Another big reason is the amount of code implicated to support this which brings
me to the next request: please use a new kconfig to wrap this code into its own
kconfig entry.

The fallback mechanism code with CONFIG_FW_LOADER_USER_HELPER eats up
13436 bytes for instance and Josh has told me that even if Android
does enable it, there are still embedded devices out there that do not
want it and do want to reduce the size of their kernels by these
13436 bytes when possible.

How much code does enabling your code have to the kernel? Please add
that to the kconfig entry.

Oping in for a new mechanism via a kconfig is clearer to understand and
maintain, less code for folks, and specially since only a coupe of drivers
would be using this, its otherwise insane to enable by default.

In fact I'm now thinking this new fallback mechanism may be an
alternative to CONFIG_FW_LOADER_USER_HELPER but it very likely
can only work well for small firmware. How big are the currently
known firmwares BTW?

OK, so only *one* upstream driver... Yeah with even more reason to never
consider this seriously by default upstream. It should be an opt-in
mechanism by drivers explicitly. In fact, it makes then wonder if we want
to even allow for the default fallback mechanism on the new call. I'm inclined
to suggest to *not* use it, given the intent and goal is clear by the
driver: first look for the file, if not found look for the firmware stashed
on on the EFI EFI_BOOT_SERVICES_CODE.

I just track linux-next separately on a different directory for this reason and
have it just --follow Linus' tree

> which subsys tree has

You can also rely on just Greg's driver-core tree and use the driver-core-next
branch [1], you can look at the new firmware_request_cache() for an example of
a new call but note that you want something more like
request_firmware_direct(). Note that this will soon be renamed to
firmware_request_direct() to follow the convention of API name prefix first, so
be sure to use the firmware_ prefix for your new call as with
firmware_request_cache().

Yes but you are not maintaining this code, I am and I have no faith a drive-by
patch author will come back and extend this later when needed.  As such, yes
please use a linked list to enable us to easily grow this now.

If a linked list is *really* an issue, I'd like to know how. For instance, if
its a lot of bytes of code its worth considering then, specially if this is for
embedded. The inability to easily support growth is just concerning here.

Sure. So to be clear without the above mapping we won't be able to find
the firmware. Also, the above should imply we have a respective upstream
driver per entry ? If so can you annotate some how which driver?

Or better yet... maintaining the above seems rather painful. Why not just let
the driver list this on its own with a macro, this way we don't have such a
list? I think there are parsers for example of MODULE_FIRMWARE() and if a
driver lists it, and the driver requires the firmware on boot I think some
tools include the driver's firmware on initramfs. Could something similar be
done to construct such a table automatically given the drivers enabled only
with their respective macro issued?

This way also if no driver is enabled that needs this, the code can just be
disabled and we save some more bytes on the kernel.

Then best document very well.

Yay.
