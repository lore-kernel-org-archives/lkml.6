Why?  AT_EMPTY_PATH/AT_NO_AUTOMOUNT are common with other ...at()
syscalls; AT_RECURSIVE - maybe, but it's still more like AT_...
namespace fodder, IMO.

Nah, better put those bits in the same word, as in above.  Here bits 0, 2, 4, 6,
8 and 11 tell which attributes are to be modified, with values to set living
in bits 1, 3, 5, 7, 9--10 and 12--13.  Look at the constants above..

Huh?  That's precisely what I'm doing there: bit 8 is "want to change atime
settings", bits 9 and 10 hold a 4-element enumeration (rel/no/nodir/strict).
Similar for propagation settings (bit 11 indicates that we want to set those,
bits 12 and 13 - 4-element enum)...

Why?  MOUNT_SETATTR_PRIVATE | MOUNT_NOATIME | MOUNT_SUID, i.e. 00101100010000,
i.e. 0xb10 for "turn nosuid off, switch atime polcy to noatime, change propagation
to private, leave everything else as-is"...

And for fsck sake, what's that "void *reserved5" for?

Point.

Why not O_CLOEXEC, as with epoll_create()/timerfd_create()/etc.?

Why?  How are those different from normal AT_EMPTY_PATH/AT_NO_AUTOMOUNT?

You can't - mount(2) uses LOOKUP_FOLLOW for mountpoint (well, user_path(),
actually).
