Yes. How long that is depends on the platform. I think the minimum is 1 
release cycle. Some stable platforms are years. If there are other DT 
changes with new features everyone should want/need, then that can be a 
decision point.

Given this is a shared IP block it's harder to know, so you may need to 
err on the longer side.

It is only an ABI break if someone notices.
