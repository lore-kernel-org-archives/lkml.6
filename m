Is this the repository used for the LoRa subsystem now?!!!
If it is, than great!

As the previous mails, I am trying to implement the LoRaWAN
specification as the soft MAC as the MAC layer over LoRa PHY.
This is the the talk about LoRaWAN class module I gave in Netdev Conf
https://www.slideshare.net/chienhungpan/lorawan-class-module-and-subsystem

The expectation is:

socket APIs:
send and receive the data
------------------------------------------------------------
LoRaWAN class module implements MAC:
append the header/footer, encryption/decryption, timing slot and MAC comman=
ds
------------------------------------------------------------
LoRa device drivers:
send and receive the messages for MAC layer
------------------------------------------------------------
LoRa devices

Is it possible that combine the LoRaWAN class module I implemented?
I start from the simplest class A end device's behavior, especially
the timing slot.
Also the encryption/decryption for uplink/downlink data messages.
I can send it as patches.

However, I have 2 problems right now.
1. Which Address and Protocol Family should we use?  PF_LORA or PF_LORAWAN?
2. To test the LoRaWAN class module, adding more procedures in LoRa
device drivers to register as a LoRaWAN device is needed.
