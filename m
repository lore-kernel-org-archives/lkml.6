Hi Ted,

Can you provide any debug patch to detect when this corruption is 
happening?
Source of this corruption and how this is partition getting corrupted?
Or which file system operation lead to this corruption?

I am digging code a bit around this warning to understand more.

Thanks in advance for your help.

-Thanks, Prasad
