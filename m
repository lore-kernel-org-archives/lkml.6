git log/blame exist for a reason and in case that does not work asking
around might give answers as well.

cpu p->states are exactly the same. This is still early boot. Nothing has
fiddled with any of this.

Please stop assuming things. Figure the root cause out, really.

I can see the intention now, but this is exactly why precise wording and
problem description and root cause analysis matter. It just confused me
completely,

Fair enough. I missed that. It would have been more obvious to mark the
patch RFC and add exactly this into the changelog.
