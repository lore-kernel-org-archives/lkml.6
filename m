syzkaller has 2 techniques to deal with checksums, if you are
interested I can go into more detail.

Note there are also specifically crafted images that can be
automounted whenever one plugs something into USB.

Just asked.

Note that coverage-guidance does not necessary mean bit flipping.
syzkaller combines coverage-guidance with grammar-awareness and other
smartness.

Based on our experience with network testing, main advantage of
syzkaller over just feeding blobs as network packets (even if these
blobs are built in a very smart way) is the following. syzkaller can
build complex interactions between syscalls, external inputs and
blobs. For example, handling of external network packets depend on if
there is an open socket on that port, what setsockopts were called, if
there is a pending receive, what flags were passed to that receive,
were some data sent the other way, etc. For filesystems that would be
various filesystem syscalls executed against the mounted image,
concurrent umount, rebind, switch to read-only mode, etc.
But maybe xfstests do this too, I don't know. Do they?
