HMM private (HMM public is different) works around that by looking for
"hole" in address space and using those for hotplug (ie page_to_pfn()
!= physical pfn of the memory). This is ok for HMM because the memory
is never map by the CPU and we can find the physical pfn with a little
bit of math (page_to_pfn() - page->pgmap->res->start + page->pgmap->dev->
physical_base_address).

To avoid anything going bad i actually do not populate the kernel linear
mapping for the range hence definitly no CPU access at all through those
struct page. CPU can still access PCIE bar through usual mmio map.

Well this again a new user of struct page for device memory just for
one usecase. I wanted HMM to be more versatile so that it could be use
for this kind of thing too. I guess the message didn't go through. I
will take some cycles tomorrow to look into this patchset to ascertain
how struct page is use in this context.

Note that i also want peer to peer for HMM users but with ACS and using
IOMMU ie having to populate IOMMU page table of one device to point to
bar of another device. I need to test on how many platform this work,
hardware engineer are unable/unwilling to commit on wether this work or
not.

If it is only needed for that this sounds like a waste of memory for
struct page. Thought i understand this allow new API to match previous
one.
