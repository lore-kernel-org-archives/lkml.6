This came as a bit of a surprise to our PCIe architect.

His follow up was whether it was worth raising an ECR for the PCIe spec
to add a capability bit to allow this to be discovered.  This might
long term avoid the need to maintain the white list for new devices.

So is it worth having a long term solution for making this discoverable?
