Not sure I follow you here - what pages are going to be zeroed and
when will they be zeroed? If discard is not allowed, filesystems
just don't issue such commands and the underlying device will never
seen them.

You can't use truncate to free space in a disk image file. The only
way to do it safely in a generic, filesystem agnositic way is to
mount the disk image (e.g. on loopback) and run fstrim on it. The
loopback device will punches holes in the file where all the free
space is reported by the filesystem via discard requests.

Which is kinda my point - this could only be done if the guest is
shut down, which makes it very difficult for admins to manage.

So you're going to be remapping a huge number of disjoint regions
into a linear pmem mapping? ISTR discussions about similar things
for virtio+fuse+dax that came up against "large numbers of mapped
regions don't scale" and so it wasn't a practical solution compared
to a just using raw sparse files....

Sure, but the question is why do you need to create an emulation
that doesn't actually perform like pmem? The whole point of pmem is
performance, and emulating pmem by mmap() of a file on spinning
disks is going to be horrible for performance. Even on SSDs it's
going to be orders of magnitudes slower than real pmem.

So exactly what problem are you trying to solve with this driver?

Cheers,

Dave.
