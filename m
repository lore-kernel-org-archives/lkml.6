Such support is already here (about to be queued):

I would expect it to be enabled more widely (Linux distros), though only
the support for instructions currently in the NOP space.

There is also the ARMv8.5 MTE (memory tagging) which relies on tagged
pointers.

An alternative would be to allow the opt-in to 52-bit VA, leaving it at
48-bit by default. However, it has the problem of changing the PAC size
and not being able to return.

This may work but, as you said, TBI is user ABI at this point, we can't
take it away now (at the time we didn't forsee the pauth).

Talking briefly with Will/Kristina/Mark, I think the best option is to
make 52-bit VA default off in the kernel config. Whoever needs it
enabled (enterprise systems) should be aware of the reduced PAC bits. I
don't really think we have a better solution.
