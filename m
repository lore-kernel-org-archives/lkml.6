I guess that's informative of how one company's distro process works,
but it's not representative. Your customers are enterprise and
big-server (probably mostly the former) oriented which is exactly the
domain where 32-bit is of course irrelevant except for running legacy
applications. Where it matters are embedded and other systems striving
for resource efficiency.

For what it's worth, 32-bit archs including i386 and many others are
well-supported in Debian with no forseeable EOL I'm aware of, and most
if not all of the musl-libc-based distros I'm familiar with support
32-bit archs including i386.

I don't think waning relevance of 32-bit is a reasonable argument
against x32 since x32's relevance is in exactly the places where
32-bit is already relevant and preferred for important reasons.
