Everything except the quoting/provisioning code would use the unprivileged node.

Either 0666 (world) or an sgx group.

Root only.

The idea here is that, under normal circumstances, provisioning only
runs once, or at least only runs rarely.  So, rather than the SDK
running provisioning whenever it feels like doing so (which is the
current behavior, I imagine, although I haven't looked), there would
be a privileged program, perhaps a systemd unit that runs when needed,
that produces the key material needed for remote attestation, and
non-root users that need attestation would get the keying material
from the provisioning service.  And the provisioning service could
implement its own policy.  Ideally, the service wouldn't give the
sealed keys to users at all but would, instead, just provide the
entire attestation service over a UNIX socket, which would make
provisioning capabilities revocable.

Does this make sense?
