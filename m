I agree that simply being builtin isn't a sufficient argument for getting
rid of pciehp_remove().

But if we do need pciehp_remove(), we should be able to make a rational
case for why that is.  If we're about to turn off the power, it's not
obvious why we would need to deallocate memory, remove sysfs stuff, etc.
If we need to configure the hardware to make it easier for a kexec'd
kernel, that's a possible argument but we should make it explicit.
