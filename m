Well, in that case, I assume the driver would also need work
differently, but when looking at the code in patch2 this doesn't seem
to be the case.

Thanks for sharing this. However this confirms my view, it looks
exactly as a new improved mmci variant. :-)

That's fine. I don't have a problem extending the mmci driver, even
several times, as to cope with new revisions.

Right, that may explain things a bit.

However, besides a re-name of the registers, I really think that the
code execution, dealing with IRQs etc, is very similar to the mmci
driver. Isn't it?

So, I think it's at least worth to give it a go with the mmci driver
first, to see if we can get it to work.

I guess you understand why I am pushing!? This is about maintenance -
and I really want to avoid having a yet another driver to maintain,
unless we can extend an existing one.

Kind regards
