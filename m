No, I think it's fine to have iATU unroll reference (since kernel also seems to
support iATU unroll).

What I meant is, we should add more flexibility on defining iATU address space
(while making sure it doesn't break existing binding).

I'm okay with this patch once you fix the compatible comment but in general
this is what I'd like to have (in a future patch)

*)  Add a new compatible "snps,dw-pcie-4.80";
*) In the kernel "iatu_unroll_enabled" should be set based on the above compatible
*) Define the a new reg space for iATU in 4.80

And these have to be done in a way it doesn't break existing binding.

Thanks
Kishon
