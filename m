Hi Richard,

There was a post to uml-devel during the days when the sourceforge 
mailing list was working in random drop mode which claimed that "this 
fixes the arm build".

I have not kept it locally and I do not see it the archive (I do not see 
a few other posts there either - including some of mine).

The joys of having a broken list :(

Whoever posted it, if you are reading it, please re-post again so we can 
have a look.

In the meantime we are as you said - x86 only.

A.
