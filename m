sdhci_pltfm_clk_get_max_clock() returns the current frequency of the
clock, which may not be an accurate maximum.

Also, even if we don't support DDR modes now, we may want to enable them
in the future, at which point we'll need to move to something similar to
the above again, albeit maybe with some of the issues that you mentioned
fixed.

I wonder if we have access to the target mode in this function, because
it seems to me like we'd need to take that into account when determining
the maximum clock rate. Or perhaps the double-rate aspect is already
dealt with in other parts of the MMC subsystem, so the value we should
return here may not even need to take the mode into account.

All of the above said, it is true that we don't enable DDR modes as of
now, and this patch seems like it shouldn't break anything either, so:

I also gave this a brief run on Jetson TK1 and things seem to work fine,
so:
