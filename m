Thanks for explaining.

So I don't know about temp sensors - I'm talking about amd_nb which is
something... well, I explained already what it is in my previous mail so
I won't repeat myself.

Anyway, if there is such a PNP ID device - and I believe I have stumbled
upon some blurb about it in the BKDGs - which says "this device
represents the PCI device IDs of a CPU" and if that can be used to
register amd_nb through it, then sure, I don't see why not.

This way, when new CPU comes out and the same PNP ID device is present,
amd_nb would load, sure.

Maybe Brian knows more on the subject...
