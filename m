Ok, so I started hacking this up in core code with the percpu flag (since
riscv apparently needs it), but I've now realised that I don't understand
how the PowerPC trick works after all. Consider the following:

	spin_lock(&foo);	// io_sync = 0
	outb(42, port);		// io_sync = 1
	spin_lock(&bar);	// io_sync = 0
	...
	spin_unlock(&bar);
	spin_unlock(&foo);

The inner lock could even happen in an irq afaict, but we'll end up skipping
the mmiowb()/sync because the io_sync flag is unconditionally cleared by
spin_lock(). Fixing this is complicated by the fact that I/O writes can be
performed in preemptible context with no locks held, so we can end up
spuriously setting the io_sync flag for arbitrary CPUs, hence the desire
to clear it in spin_lock().

If the paca entry was more than a byte, we could probably track that a
spinlock is held and then avoid clearing the flag prematurely, but I have
a feeling that I'm missing something. Anybody know how this is supposed to
work?
