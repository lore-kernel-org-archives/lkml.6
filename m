Aha, that was quick :-). Interesting, let me take a look.

I'm not sure what "directly" and "client" is here, but yes, it seems
that motmdm9 just delivers messages, and if you don't ack them,
network will just keep retransmitting the message.

I have ofone with direct AT access --
https://github.com/pavelmachek/unicsy_demo/blob/master/ofone/at.py .

And then better solution using ofone + ofonod.

https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/150

Now, ttyUSB4 provides quite a rich interface, and you can actually
select what if you want messages in text and PDU format, and if you
want modem to auto-acknowledge messages for you.

(But I don't think all options work).

It may be even possible to select if you want the messages to be
queued or delivered directly.

Not sure what goes on there.

Same as above -- in text mode sending messages is very easy (can be
done by hand in minicom, or at.py can do it), and ofonod can already
do PDU encoding etc.

What kind of battery life do you get with all the optimalizations?
IIRC I was getting 7h with ttyUSB4 in use...
