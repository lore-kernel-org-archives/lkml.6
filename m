Agreed. There is nothing interrupt specific in that code aside of some
name choices.

Btw, while I have your attention. There popped up an issue recently related
to that affinity logic.

The current implementation fails when:

        /*
         * If there aren't any vectors left after applying the pre/post
         * vectors don't bother with assigning affinity.
	 */
	if (nvecs == affd->pre_vectors + affd->post_vectors)
    		return NULL;

Now the discussion arised, that in that case the affinity sets are not
allocated and filled in for the pre/post vectors, but somehow the
underlying device still works and later on triggers the warning in the
blk-mq code because the MSI entries do not have affinity information
attached.

Sure, we could make that work, but there are several issues:

    1) irq_create_affinity_masks() has another reason to return NULL:
       memory allocation fails.

    2) Does it make sense at all.

Right now the PCI allocator ignores the NULL return and proceeds without
setting any affinities. As a consequence nothing is managed and everything
happens to work.

But that happens to work is more by chance than by design and the warning
is bogus if this is an expected mode of operation.

We should address these points in some way.

Thanks,
