In fact, ST designers which created stm32-sdmmc hardware block from 
scratch are the same which have done the modifications on pl180 variant 
(stm32 legacy f4, f7).
So some registers or bits name seem identical (or strongly inspirited) 
but the engine and features are different.

You could find the datasheet of STM32H7x3 on:
http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/reference_manual/group0/c9/a3/76/fa/55/46/45/fa/DM00314099/files/DM00314099.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.DM00314099.pdf

Chapters: 55 Secure digital input/output MultiMediaCard interface
(SDMMC)

This hardware block has own roadmap and some features are already in the 
pipe for next SoC.

For code design: like I also worked on pl180 in the past :-)
my code is inspirited of this driver.
