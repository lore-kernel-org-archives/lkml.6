Absolutely, yes :) I am actively working on it in parallel, you can
check the third version there [1]. Stephen Boyd has a slightly
different idea of how it should be done, I will propose a v4 this week,
I can add you in copy if you are interested!

Anyway, there is one thing that is still missing:
* Let's have device A that requests clock B
* With the device link series, A is linked (as a child) to B.
* A suspend/resume hooks handle things in the NOIRQ phase.
* B suspend/resume hooks handle things in the default phase.

What I expected during a suspend:
1/ ->suspend_noirq(device A)
2/ ->suspend(clock B)

Unfortunately, device links do not seem to enforce any priority between
phases (default/late/noirq) and what happens is:
1/ ->suspend(B)
2/ ->suspend_noirq(A)
Which has no sense in my case. Hence, I had to request the clock
suspend/resume callbacks to be upgraded to the NOIRQ phase as well (I
don't have a better solution for now). This is still under discussion
in a thread you have been recently added to by Bjorn, see [2].

So when I told you I was not confident in "reworking the PM core to
respect such dependency", this is what I was referring to. I am
definitely ready to help, but I don't feel I can do it alone.
