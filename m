its devices would be nice.

BIOS info is not used when we enumerate devices, so I don't think there's
really anything to discard.

Let's simplify the situation by focusing only on v4.17.  We can
also ignore the Broadcom driver, since it's not involved in enumeration.

I don't know what "port 3" and "ports 4-7" refer to.  Are these labels on
slots in an expansion chassis?  Something from lspci, e.g., the port number
from Link Capabilites, or the slot number from Slot Capabilities?

> - Why do I need a hotplug event to push the device name into the kernel
after a cold start?  This is complete madness, isn't it?

I don't know why the hotplug would make a difference.  It does sound like
complete madness.

> - Why are resources allocated while the PCI slot is empty?

I don't know exactly what resources you're referring to (bus numbers, MMIO
space, I/O port space).  In general we try to allocate some space for all
of those even if the slot is currently empty, because that makes it
possible to hot-add devices in the slot later.

In this case, the bus number space is quite constrained because the host
bridge leading to the PEX switch only supports [bus 40-4f].  But I think
that should be enough for this case, since the only switch in this tree is
the PEX, and your Bonaire/Tobago/Ellesmere devices are all endpoints that
only require one bus number each.

If you run "lspci -vv" as root, it'll decode more details.
