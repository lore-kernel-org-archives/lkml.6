That is only true, if CPU 4-7 are in the present mask at boot time. I
seriously doubt that this is the case for Kashyaps scenario. Grrr, if you
would have included him into the Reported-by: tags then I could have asked
him myself.

In the physical hotplug case, the physcially (or virtually) not available
CPUs are not in the present mask. They are solely in the possible mask.

The above is about soft hotplug where the CPUs are physically there and
therefore in the present mask and can be onlined without interaction from
the outside (mechanical or virt config).

If nobody objects, I'll make that change and queue the stuff tomorrow
morning so it can brew a few days in next before I send it off to Linus.

Thanks,
