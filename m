I am working actively to bring A3700 SoC suspend to RAM support almost
from scratch. 

As of today I have contributed 65 patches spread in 8 series for the
PHY, clk, PCIe, SATA, USB, pinctrl and net subsystems. Some of them
have been merged, but the vast majority has not, yet.

I mentioned this run-time dependency because it exists for people who
would like to test just the PCIe IP. But S2RAM on A3700 will be a
new-broken-feature until all patches are merged. While there is
still one missing, the feature is broken. If everybody waits for
the other patches to be merged first, it is gonna be a long process :)

However, if you want to wait for the clock core series to be applied
first I respect this choice and I will update you when it will be the
case.


Thanks,
Miquèl
