We definitely don't have that many flags, and I'd hate to add a
per-whatever flag for this.

But do we need that? We really just need single flag for this, my main
worry was overloading ENTERED. Especially since we're adding different
clearing and setting for it. If we had a specific one, if it's set, we
would need to disallow merging for it, I guess.

And there's already BIO_THROTTLED...
