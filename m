I would change this in something like:

"If you are adding a new interface to the FPGA framework, add it on
top of a FPGA region."

What I understand from the current statement is:
"if you care about re-usability, add your interface on top of an FPGA region" 
Since in my special case, I do not care about re-usability, I skipped the FPGA 
region.

Yes, like that more or less.

I did a chardevice in /dev/ because in our environment debugfs is not mounted 
automatically and we need this feature also operationally. But yes, that's the 
idea.

One comment. The code on github [1] looks like it is assuming that on 
userspace people write the full image in one shot and it is smaller that 4MiB. 
What I did is to build a scatterlist in order to support the following case:

cat image.bin > /sys/kernel/debug/.../image

where `cat` write 4K at time. And it can be bigger than 4M

[1] https://github.com/altera-opensource/linux-socfpga/blob/socfpga-4.17/
drivers/fpga/fpga-mgr-debugfs.c

Below (end of this email) the patch I quickly did last year. Unfortunately I 
do not have the time to clean this solution, so it is the very first thing I 
implemented without many thoughts (that's why I never pushed this patch).
