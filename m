Hi Suzuki, sorry for my unclear decription before.
Without ksm fixing patch and injecting fault debugging patch, I ever met WARN_ON
storm(easily reproduced) and panic on unmap_stage2_range(only once).
After the injecting fault debugging patch, the panic can be easily reproduced,
hence I thought the panic was also caused by the same root cause.

After ksm fixing patch, the WARN_ON and panic are both disappearred.

What I mean is:
1. if PAGE_SIZE alignment *should* be guaranteed in handle_hva_to_gpa, it would
be better to add a WARN_ON or WARN_ON_ONCE in unmap_stage2_range()

2. if PAGE_SIZE alignment is *not* guaranteed, handle_hva_to_gpa needs to handle
the unalignment cases, I will propose to change the codes in handle_hva_to_gpa.
eg. use (gpa_end-gpa) instead of (hva_end - hva_start)

Cheers,
Jia
