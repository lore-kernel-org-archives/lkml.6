The patches Uffe mentions are related to this. In brcmfmac we simply 
implemented functionality to create a scatter list and send it through 
the MMC stack using SDIO CMD53. It is in the creation of the scatter 
list that these alignment properties are needed. Moving the whole 
functionality to the MMC stack will also move those properties into 
their right context, ie. SDIO host controller.

Our broker_sg_support property is basically doing the bounce buffer 
thing if I understand it correctly.

Arend
