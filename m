The original commit, f67fd55fa96f ("PCI: Add quirk for still enabled
interrupts on Intel Sandy Bridge GPUs"), says some systems "crash"
(not sure if that means an oops or an actual crash that requires a
reboot) and on other systems, Linux disables the shared interrupt
line.  I assume disabling the interrupt line keeps devices using that
line from working, but does not directly cause a crash.

What specific symptom do you see here?  I think it might be useful to
collect details, e.g., dmesg logs, /proc/interrupts contents, output
of "sudo lspci -vv", etc., for the systems you're quirking here.  I'm
hoping we can eventually figure out a solution that doesn't require a
quirk for every new GPU, and maybe that info will help find it.

If this is a VGA BIOS defect, it's not very likely that it will
magically be fixed for all new Intel GPUs, so in effect it sounds like
we need to update this list of quirks in Linux every time a new Intel
GPU comes out.  That prospect is a little daunting.

Do you happen to know if Windows has the same problem?  I.e., if you
boot an old version of Windows with a new GPU, and unplug the VGA
cable, does Windows crash?  If Windows can figure out how to handle
that situation gracefully, Linux should be able to do it, too.
