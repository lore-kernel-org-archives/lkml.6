Hi Paul,

I need -rr behaviour for doing IO load-balancing when I choose next RDMA
connection from the list in order to send a request, i.e. my code is
something like the following:

        static struct conn *get_and_set_next_conn(void)
        {
                struct conn *conn;

                conn = rcu_dereferece(rcu_conn);
                if (unlikely(!conn))
                    return conn;
                conn = list_next_or_null_rr_rcu(&conn_list,
                                                &conn->entry,
                                                typeof(*conn),
                                                entry);
                rcu_assign_pointer(rcu_conn, conn);
                return conn;
        }

        rcu_read_lock();
        conn = get_and_set_next_conn();
        if (unlikely(!conn)) {
                /* ... */
        }
        err = rdma_io(conn, request);
        rcu_read_unlock();

i.e. usage of the @next pointer is under an RCU critical section.

The difference is that I do not need a loop, I take the @next conn pointer,
save it for the following IO request and do IO for current IO request.

It seems list_for_each_entry_rcu()-like with immediate "break" in the body
of the loop does not look nice, I personally do not like it, i.e.:


        static struct conn *get_and_set_next_conn(void)
        {
                struct conn *conn;

                conn = rcu_dereferece(rcu_conn);
                if (unlikely(!conn))
                    return conn;
                list_for_each_entry_rr_rcu(conn, &conn_list,
                                           entry) {
                        break;
                }
                rcu_assign_pointer(rcu_conn, conn);
                return conn;
        }


or maybe I did not fully get your idea?

The only one list_for_each_entry_rcu()-like macro I am aware of is used in
block/blk-mq-sched.c, is called list_for_each_entry_rcu_rr():

https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.17-rc5/source/block/blk-mq-sched.c#L370

Does it make sense to implement generic list_next_or_null_rr_rcu() reusing
my list_next_or_null_rr_rcu() variant?

Thanks for clear explanation.
