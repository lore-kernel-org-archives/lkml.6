With Thunderbolt, up to 6 devices may be daisy-chained.  This means that a
hotplug port may have further hotplug ports as (grand-)children.

If power is turned off manually via sysfs for a hotplug port, all children
(including hotplug ports) are removed by pciehp even though they physically
remain attached to the machine.  If such removed-in-software-but-physically-
still-present devices send an interrupt, and interrupts were not orderly
disabled on ->remove, they will be considered spurious interrupts by genirq
code.  In particular, level-triggered INTx interrupts will immediately lead
to an unpleasant user-visible splat and the interrupt will be switched to
polling.

So there's no way around orderly disabling interrupts in the ->remove path.

I agree that ->shutdown is a different story in principle and that disabling
devices seems superfluous and counter-intuitive.  I imagine kexec might not
be the only reason, but also devices passed through to VMs.  (What happens
if a VM hands a device back to the host in an unclean state on shutdown?)

Thanks,

Lukas
