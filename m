Subject: [PATCH v2 1/2] genirq: Update code comments wrt recycled thread_mask

Previously a race existed between __free_irq() and __setup_irq() wherein
the thread_mask of a just removed action could be handed out to a newly
added action and the freed irq thread would then tread on the oneshot
mask bit of the newly added irq thread in irq_finalize_oneshot():

time
 |  __free_irq()
 |    raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&desc->lock, flags);
 |    <remove action from linked list>
 |    raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore(&desc->lock, flags);
 |
 |  __setup_irq()
 |    raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&desc->lock, flags);
 |    <traverse linked list to determine oneshot mask bit>
 |    raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore(&desc->lock, flags);
 |
 |  irq_thread() of freed irq (__free_irq() waits in synchronize_irq())
 |    irq_thread_fn()
 |      irq_finalize_oneshot()
 |        raw_spin_lock_irq(&desc->lock);
 |        desc->threads_oneshot &= ~action->thread_mask;
 |        raw_spin_unlock_irq(&desc->lock);
 v

The race was known at least since 2012 when it was documented in a code
comment by commit e04268b0effc ("genirq: Remove paranoid warnons and
bogus fixups").

But it wasn't until 2017 that it was fixed by commit 9114014cf4e6
("genirq: Add mutex to irq desc to serialize request/free_irq()"),
apparently inadvertantly so because the race is neither mentioned in the
commit message nor was the code comment updated.  Make up for that.
