Ok, so a task could be marked as filtered but its children would still
be auditable and inheriting its parent containerid (as well at its
loginuid and sessionid)...

Yes, probably.

I don't remember, specifically.  Maybe this has been addressed by the
check for children/threads or identical parent container ID.  So, I'm
reluctantly willing to remove that check for now.

Isn't that just (struct task_struct)parent == (struct
task_struct)child->parent (or ->real_parent)?

And now that I say that, it is covered by the following patch's child
check, so as long as we keep that, we should be fine.
