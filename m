Those were consumed by KVM support, which needed to detect if CPUs had
mismatched support. Currently they're just placeholders as I need a
cpucap value for the separate IMP-DEF / architected probing cases.

I *could* get rid of those and just have the ARM64_HAS_ADDRESS_AUTH case
log "Address authentication", but I wanted to have separate messages for
IMP-DEF vs architected.

Thanks,
Mark.
