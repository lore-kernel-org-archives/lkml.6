I opened this bugzilla and attached the dmesg and lspci -vv output to
it: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199695

The root port at 00:1c.0 leads to the NVMe device at 01:00.0 (this is
nvme0):

  00:1c.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Sunrise Point-LP PCI Express Root Port #5 (rev f1) (prog-if 00 [Normal decode])
        Bus: primary=00, secondary=01, subordinate=01, sec-latency=0
  01:00.0 Non-Volatile memory controller: Samsung Electronics Co Ltd NVMe SSD Controller SM961/PM961 (prog-if 02 [NVM Express])
        Subsystem: Samsung Electronics Co Ltd Device a801

We reported several corrected errors before the nvme timeout:

  [12750.281158] nvme nvme0: controller is down; will reset: CSTS=0xffffffff, PCI_STATUS=0x10
  [12750.297594] nvme nvme0: I/O 455 QID 2 timeout, disable controller
  [12750.305196] nvme 0000:01:00.0: enabling device (0000 -> 0002)
  [12750.305465] nvme nvme0: Removing after probe failure status: -19
  [12750.313188] nvme nvme0: I/O 456 QID 2 timeout, disable controller
  [12750.329152] nvme nvme0: I/O 457 QID 2 timeout, disable controller

The corrected errors are supposedly recovered in hardware without
software intervention, and AER logs them for informational purposes.

But it seems very likely that these corrected errors are related to
the nvme timeout: the first corrected errors were logged at
12720.894411, nvme_io_timeout defaults to 30 seconds, and the nvme
timeout was at 12750.281158.

I don't have any good ideas.  As a shot in the dark, you could try
running these commands before doing a suspend:

  # setpci -s01:00.0 0x98.W
  # setpci -s00:1c.0 0x68.W
  # setpci -s01:00.0 0x198.L
  # setpci -s00:1c.0 0x208.L

  # setpci -s01:00.0 0x198.L=0x00000000
  # setpci -s01:00.0 0x98.W=0x0000
  # setpci -s00:1c.0 0x208.L=0x00000000
  # setpci -s00:1c.0 0x68.W=0x0000

  # lspci -vv -s00:1c.0
  # lspci -vv -s01:00.0

The idea is to turn off ASPM L1.2 and LTR, just because that's new and
we've had issues with it before.  If you try this, please collect the
output of the commands above in addition to the dmesg log, in case my
math is bad.
