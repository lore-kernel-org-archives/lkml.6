Well the SDIO dat line interrupt is working just fine with
mwifiex_sdio driver and runtime PM like I said :)

Hmm not sure if this is needed here. When things enter idle, the whole
SDIO block is off and the SDIO dat interrupt is delivered as wakeirq to
the pinctrl-single driver instead that manages padconf wake events.
Then we have runtime PM wake up MMC subsystem and the SDIO dat line
interrupt is still there and will trigger as it's level sensitive.

So the test to do would be simply configure wlcore to use SDIO dat line
interrupt instead of the GPIO interrupt and configure a wakeirq for
the board on the SDIO dat line. Sounds like I need to get my wlcore
runtime PM patches ready though as that is needed for using the wakeirq.

Regards,

Tony
