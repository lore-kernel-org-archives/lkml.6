I actually don't know for sure what device caused the issue or what
state it was in.  George, if you could clarify that, it would be
helpful.

My assumption (possibly incorrect) is that the issue happens when we
read config space of an endpoint behind a PCIe bridge that is in D3.
The PCIe portdrv binds to the bridge before the pci_sysfs_init()
late_initcall happens, and it enables runtime PM on the bridge, so
it's possible the bridge is in D3 before pci_sysfs_init() happens.

That comment was added by 967577b06241 ("PCI/PM: Keep runtime PM
enabled for unbound PCI devices"), apparently because "some devices do
not work again after being put into D3".  That commit mentions
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=48201 but I don't think
it's completely convincing about the requirement for keeping things in
D0.

Even if it's true that some devices don't work after being in D3, that
doesn't seem like sufficient reason to keep *all* devices on all
systems in D0.  We would normally use quirks to address device issues
like this.

s/pci_init_pm/pci_pm_init/

That's an interesting idea.  I hadn't thought of the case where a
device is not in D0 when we enumerate it.  We *do* make sure bridges
are in D0 before scanning behind them (pci_scan_bridge_extend() calls
pm_runtime_get_sync()).

Since enumeration should only perform config accesses, and devices
must respond to config accesses even when in D3hot, I guess I'm not
convinced that we need to power up everything (other than bridges)
during enumeration.
