Ah thanks ! Thanks explains. We can fix that on ppc64 in our linear
mapping code by checking the address vs. memblocks to chose the right
page table attributes.

So the main problem on our side is to figure out the problem of too big
PFNs. I need to look at this with Aneesh, we might be able to make
things fit with a bit of wrangling.
