Sure, I can do that.

Right. This is for two reasons (though if you disagree with these
semantics we can change this as well):

1. It's not clear to me whether openat(somefd->"/", "/tmp", O_XDEV)
   should return an -EXDEV or completely ignore the starting point. Same
   argument with AT_FDCWD. I opted to make it so that the starting point
   has to be on the same mountpoint, but I totally understand if you
   feel this is insane -- and I'd be happy to change it. The real
   problem comes from (2).

2. AT_THIS_ROOT chroot-scope absolute paths, and so in the second patch
   LOOKUP_CHROOT also triggers this codepath. The main argument for this
   semantic is somewhat elaborated in the cover letter -- but
   the short version is because AT_THIS_ROOT has to chroot-scope
   absolute symlinks it would be somewhat strange if it didn't scope
   absolute paths you give it -- otherwise it could either be a footgun
   or would require always returning -EXDEV here.

   Though, as above, if you feel that the current semantics (absolute
   paths override whatever dirfd you give), then -EXDEV is the
   alternative I would pitch.

We wouldn't discard it -- nd_jump_root() will check whether a mount
crossing was implied here (otherwise an absolute symlink could cause you
to cross a mountpoint).

But as above, if you'd prefer that absolute paths disable all dirfd
handling (as is the case now), I can remove this semantic.

The reasoning for this is because of how AT_THIS_ROOT uses both of these
codepaths (it causes dirfd_path_init() to be called before the absolute
check, and also causes ->root to be set).

I wrote the features in parallel and then split out the code for
AT_THIS_ROOT so it could be discussed separately (and so removing it if
it was rejected would be simpler). But unfortunately this does result in
the dirfd_path_init() code looking completely superfluous without seeing
the second patch.

> -- you could bloody well have passed the relative pathname to start with.

(I think you mean always doing dirfd_path_init() first here?)

Right, but I didn't want to discard nd->path unnecessarily -- if we do
all of the code to grab AT_FDCWD and then it is completely unused (not
even in the AT_XDEV sense of "unused") it seems like a waste.

Did I misunderstand your suggestion? Were you referring to userspace
just being able to "[pass] the relative pathname to start with"?

Right, I could definitely do that -- though for AT_THIS_ROOT we'd
duplicate the ->root setting in both places.

Sorry about that. Would you prefer if the two patches (AT_BENEATH family
and AT_THIS_ROOT) were sent as a single patch -- with the
dirfd_path_init() code split out? Or that the second patch do all of the
structural changes to refactor dirfd_path_init() usage?
