Hi Dave,

Here is the image:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jzhGGe5SBJcqfsjxCLHoh4Kazke1oTfC/view
(took me about a minute to extract from test by replacing memfd_create
with open and running the program).
Then do the following to trigger the bug:
losetup /dev/loop0 xfs.repro
mkdir xfs
mount -t xfs -o nouuid,prjquota,noikeep,quota /dev/loop0 xfs

To answer your more general question: syzbot is not a system to test
solely file systems, it finds bugs in hundreds of kernel subsystems.
Generating image for file systems, media files for sound and
FaceDancer programs that crash host when  FaceDancer device is plugged
into USB is not feasible. And in the end it's not even clear what
kernel subsystem is at fault and even if it somehow figures out that
it's a filesystem, it's unclear that it's exactly an image that
provokes the bug. syzbot provides C reproducers which is a reasonable
common ground for bug reports. At this point the bug needs human
attention. Some bugs are trivial enough that a developer does not even
need to look at the reproducer. Some bugs are so involved that only an
expert in a particular subsystem can figure out what happens there.
