I do not think those properties are pci_epf_test specific, that's the
whole point I am making. Those are EPC controller features.

Well, it is better than the driver_data approach, I would not call them
quirks but features and for the BARs you should define a mask it does
not make sense to enumerate them. It is probably a good idea to leave
room for additional "features" so please choose the bits placement
wisely.
