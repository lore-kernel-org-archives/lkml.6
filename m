Yeah, it obviously makes no sense at all for the interrupt parent of a
PCI device to deviate from the host bridge's interrupt parent, and
it's quite unfortunate that we can't simply ban it now that the cat is
out of the bag already.

Arguably, the wake up widget is not part of the PCI device, but I have
no opinion as to whether it is better modeling it as a sub device as
you are proposing or as an entirely separate device referenced via a
phandle.
