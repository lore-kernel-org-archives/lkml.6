Yeah, it's tricky.  But I don't think it's PCI or ACPI that makes this
tricky; I think it's just the historical baggage of the PCI core
design that makes it hard.

Even in the ACPI hotplug path, I think we use this pci_scan_device()
path:

  pci_scan_device
    pci_setup_device
      case PCI_HEADER_TYPE_NORMAL:
        pci_read_bases(6)             # normal PCI BARs
      case PCI_HEADER_TYPE_BRIDGE:
        pci_read_bases(2)             # bridge BARs (not windows)

Unfortunately that path doesn't call pci_read_bridge_bases() to read
the bridge windows; that currently happens in pcibios_fixup_bus(),
which is only called from pci_scan_child_bus_extend().

This is a broken design because reading the bridge apertures is not at
all platform-specific, so it shouldn't be done in a pcibios hook.
And, more to the issue at hand, it shouldn't be done in
pci_scan_child_bus() either.  We might have to *update* the windows
when scanning child buses, but we should be able to do the work of
finding out what windows are implemented and their properties
somewhere in the pci_setup_device() path.

I'll be on vacation or holiday most of the time until the new year,
but I put a reminder on my calendar to look at this again then.  I'm
pretty sure we've tried to unravel this in the past, but I can't
remember what issues we tripped over.  Maybe we can make some progress
by restricting the problem we're trying to solve.

Thanks for bringing this up!  This is a wart in the PCI core that has
bothered me for a long time, and maybe this is the incentive we need
to make some progress on it.
