There is no such thing as "buffer" there is at first a bio, and after
virtual-to-iommu mapping a scatter-gather-list. All these are currently
governed by a struct request.
request, bio, and sgl, have a single direction, All API's expect a single
direction.

All BIDI did was to say. Lets not change any API or structure but just
use two of them at the same time.

All the wiser is the very high level user, and the very low HW driver like
iscsi. All the middlewere was never touched.

In the view of a bidi target like say an osd. It all stream looks like a single
"Buffer" on the wire, were some of it is read and some of it is written
to.

That was the all trick of not changing a single API or structure
Just have two of the same thing, we already know how to handle

No! ->special is nothing to do with bidi. ->special is a field to be
used by LLD's only and are not to be touched by block layer or transports
or high level users.
 
Request has the single ->next_rq for bidi. And could be eliminated by
sharing space with the elevator info. Do you want a patch?

(So in effect it can be taking 0 bytes, and yes a little bit of code)

Not sure what is the "SAM" above. But most of the BIDI commands I know,
osd and otherwise, the order is command specific, and many times it is
done in parallel.
Read some bits than write some bits, rinse and repeat ...

(You see in scsi the all OUT buffer is part of the actual CDB, so in effect
 any READ is a BIDI. The novelty here is the variable sizes and the SW stack
 memory targets for the different operations)

Again bidi works NOW. Did not yet see the big gain, of throwing it
out.
