AER usage is coordinated between the platform and the OS via _OSC (PCI
Firmware spec r3.2, sec 4.5.1) My understanding is that if the
platform grants the OS permission to control AER, the OS is free to
set the AER control registers however it wishes.  If the platform
depends on certain AER control settings, it must decline to grant AER
control to the OS.

As far as I know, there's nothing new in _OSC related to DPC, but
based on the implementation note in PCIe r4.0, sec 6.2.10, we
currently assume the OS controls DPC if and only if it controls AER.

Therefore, if a platform depends on certain DPC control settings,
e.g., if it wants to handle both ERR_FATAL and ERR_NONFATAL with DPC,
I would argue that the platform needs to retain control over AER.

If the platform grants AER control to the OS, I think the OS is free
to set both AER and DPC control registers as it desires.

ERR_FATAL means the link is unreliable.  A hotplug event may have
occurred.  In this case, I think remove/re-enumerate is a safe option.
It might be more than is needed in some cases, but I'm not sure we can
reliably determine when we don't need it, and if we
remove/re-enumerate for some ERR_FATAL errors but not others, I think
it complicates the situation for drivers and other higher-level
software.

ERR_NONFATAL means a particular transaction might be unreliable but
the link itself is fully functional.  No hotplug is possible if the
link has stayed fully functional.
