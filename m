No, that is the whole point. These functions may be called from atomic
context, which is why they trylock() and give up rather than block on
the semaphore if a rt services call is already in progress. E.g.,

/*
 * efivar_entry_set_nonblocking - call set_variable_nonblocking()
 *
 * This function is guaranteed to not block and is suitable for calling
 * from crash/panic handlers.
 *
 * Crucially, this function will not block if it cannot acquire
 * efivars_lock. Instead, it returns -EBUSY.

OK, then please implement that change.

Thanks,
