Hi Kees,

We know it works fine with:

linux-next's gcc 4.6.3 + binutils 2.22
my gcc 4.7.4 + binutils 2.25
kernelci.org's Linaro GCC 5.3-2016.05 toolchain (gcc 5.3.1 20160412)
Tony's using gcc 7.3.0 + binutils 2.30
Arnd's using mostly gcc 8.0.1 + binutils 2.29
What-ever toolchain Olof's autobuilder is using

which is quite a spread of versions, both binutils and gcc, and they
all work.  The autobuilders plus Arnd's are regularly verifying lots
of kernel trees (including my own) with lots of configurations, and
the identified patch has not reproduced this compile failure there.

Searching google for:

lib/string.c "error: inlining failed in call to always_inline 'strlen': function not inlinable"

gives me only three hits on mail-archive.com for this, all of them
are Pavel's email or a reply to it.  There appears to be no other
reports of compile failure anywhere else on the google-crawled
Internet.

There appears to be no information readily available as to what
compiler versions each ELDK version contains (see
http://www.denx.de/wiki/view/ELDK-5) so providing the eldk-switch
command to us gives us no useful information.

I think more information about Pavel's setup is needed, including:

* compiler version
* environment (any kernel build specific environment variables set?)
* exact make command line

Maybe even showing the exact command used by kbuild to invoke the
C compiler for lib/string.c.

It could simply be a bug in the ELDK GCC version that Pavel's using.
Could it be that DENX have patched gcc for ELDK and subtly broken
it?  We all know distros like to apply patches to packages.
