Thanks a lot for bisecting this!

With a good kernel (v4.19 or v4.20-rc with 17c91487364f reverted),
would you mind collecting "lspci -vv" output, the dmesg log with
"pci=earlydump", and the FADT dump?

I'm interested in the initial state of the device at handoff from
BIOS, and what Linux changes even when aspm_disabled is set.

If we can't figure out a way to fix both this issue and the one fixed
by 17c91487364f, I guess the fallback will be to revert 17c91487364f
since it's better to allow a system that was previously broken to
remain broken than it is to break a system that previously worked.

But obviously I hope we can figure out a solution that fixes both
cases.
