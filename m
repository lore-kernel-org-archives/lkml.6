IIUC, with the configuration below

 cpuset.cpus.effective:6-11
 cgroup.controllers:cpuset
 cpuset.mems.effective:0-1
 cgroup.subtree_control:cpuset
 g1/cpuset.cpus.effective:0-5
 g1/cgroup.controllers:cpuset
 g1/cpuset.sched.load_balance:1
 g1/cpuset.mems.effective:0-1
 g1/cpuset.cpus:0-5
 g1/cpuset.sched.domain_root:1
 user.slice/cpuset.cpus.effective:6-11
 user.slice/cgroup.controllers:cpuset
 user.slice/cpuset.sched.load_balance:1
 user.slice/cpuset.mems.effective:0-1
 user.slice/cpuset.cpus:6-11
 user.slice/cpuset.sched.domain_root:0
 init.scope/cpuset.cpus.effective:6-11
 init.scope/cgroup.controllers:cpuset
 init.scope/cpuset.sched.load_balance:1
 init.scope/cpuset.mems.effective:0-1
 init.scope/cpuset.cpus:6-11
 init.scope/cpuset.sched.domain_root:0
 system.slice/cpuset.cpus.effective:6-11
 system.slice/cgroup.controllers:cpuset
 system.slice/cpuset.sched.load_balance:1
 system.slice/cpuset.mems.effective:0-1
 system.slice/cpuset.cpus:6-11
 system.slice/cpuset.sched.domain_root:0
 machine.slice/cpuset.cpus.effective:6-11
 machine.slice/cgroup.controllers:cpuset
 machine.slice/cpuset.sched.load_balance:1
 machine.slice/cpuset.mems.effective:0-1
 machine.slice/cpuset.cpus:6-11
 machine.slice/cpuset.sched.domain_root:0

I should be able to

 # echo 0-4 >g1/cpuset.cpus

?

It doesn't let me.

I'm not sure we actually want to allow that, but that's what would I
expect as per your text above.

Thanks,

BTW: thanks a lot for your prompt feedback and hope it's OK if I keep
playing and asking questions. :)
