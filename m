Right, but this is a performace regression in comparison to v4.11, so
if "af8a41cccf8f rtlwifi: cleanup 8723be ant_sel definition" is marked
for stable, shouldn't these other patches be brought as well? All
releases since v4.11 are probably affected, but honestly I don't have
a strong understanding of how the stable trees operate in situations
like this.

With v4.11 I had good performance results on this very same machine
(thus same efuse contents) only when passing ant_sel=1, so there has
to be some change on the code that parses the efuse contents and
decides which antenna will be used.
