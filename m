Yep.

I think there's a bunch of architectures that are in the same boat.
m68k, arm, mips was mentioned. Sure, the moment an arch has hardware
support you don't need the syscall anymore.

I was just thinking it would be good to have a common implementation (if
possible) rather than 4-5 different copies of basically the same thing.
