OK, I did a bonnie++ run with Rik's patch (on top of 4.20 to rule out other
differences). This machine does not show so big differences in bonnie++
numbers but the difference is still clearly visible. The results are
(averages of 5 runs):

		 Revert			Base			Rik
SeqCreate del    78.04 (   0.00%)	98.18 ( -25.81%)	90.90 ( -16.48%)
RandCreate del   87.68 (   0.00%)	95.01 (  -8.36%)	87.66 (   0.03%)

'Revert' is 4.20 with "mm: don't reclaim inodes with many attached pages"
and "mm: slowly shrink slabs with a relatively small number of objects"
reverted. 'Base' is the kernel without any reverts. 'Rik' is a 4.20 with
Rik's patch applied.

The numbers are time to do a batch of deletes so lower is better. You can see
that the patch did help somewhat but it was not enough to close the gap
when files are deleted in 'readdir' order.
