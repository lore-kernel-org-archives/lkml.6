Oh that is nasty. Ugh. I hate the "const but not really ha ha" optimizations. :(

Yes, that would be much better. Seems like we could do a really easy
Coccinelle script to fix all of those?

@@
identifier VAR;
expression STRING;
@@

- const char VAR[]
+ const char * const VAR
  = STRING;

yields:
 517 files changed, 890 insertions(+), 891 deletions(-)

Worth doing at the end of -rc2?

If you find that bug, I'll add it to my gcc bug tracking list. :P

Okay, then I'll forward this to akpm maybe?

Yeah, fair.
