I'm afraid that this will not work for SCHED_DEADLINE (at least for how
it is implemented today). As you can see in Documentation [1] the only
way a user has to perform partitioned/clustered scheduling is to create
subset of exclusive cpusets and then assign deadline tasks to them. The
other thing to take into account here is that a root_domain is created
for each exclusive set and we use such root_domain to keep information
about admitted bandwidth and speed up load balancing decisions (there is
a max heap tracking deadlines of active tasks on each root_domain).

Now, AFAIR distinct root_domain(s) are created when parent group has
sched_load_balance disabled and cpus_exclusive set (in cgroup v1 that
is). So, what we normally do is create, say, cpus_exclusive groups for
the different clusters and then disable sched_load_balance at root level
(so that each cluster gets its own root_domain). Also,
sched_load_balance is enabled in children groups (as load balancing
inside clusters is what we actually needed :).

IIUC your proposal this will not be permitted with cgroup v2 because
sched_load_balance won't be present at root level and children groups
won't be able to set sched_load_balance back to 1 if that was set to 0
in some parent. Is that true?

Look, the way things work today is most probably not perfect (just to
say one thing, we need to disable load balancing for all classes at root
level just because DEADLINE wants to set restricted affinities to his
tasks :/) and we could probably think on how to change how this all
work. So, let's first see if IIUC what you are proposing (and its
implications). :)

Best,

- Juri
