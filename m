GFP_ATOMIC is a non-sleeping (aka no reclaim) context with an access to
memory reserves. So the risk is that you deplete those reserves and
cause issues to other subsystems which need them as well.

The compaction was able to make a reasonable forward progress for you.
But considering mlx4_alloc_icm is called with GFP_KERNEL resp. GFP_HIGHUSER
then the OOM killer is clearly possible as long as the order is lower
than 4.
