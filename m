Thanks for details. Now I see your problem. In case of low latency 
devices (PCI/SNOC/AHB),
all CE rings interrupts are serviced first and later consolidated data 
processing done
from ath10k_htt_txrx_compl_task and then ath10k_mac_tx_push_pending is 
called from NAPI Poll.

In case of high latency devices (USB/SDIO), each endpoints are serviced 
and all tx/rx jobs
are completed from the same context. Hence no need of consolidated 
processing.

This issue is specific to HL devices. But your change is common which 
will impact LL devices.
I would prefer to call ath10k_mac_tx_push_pending after processing all 
received mbox/urb messages.
Export ath10k_mac_tx_push_pending API and call it from USB/SDIO irq 
handler. Any thoughts?
