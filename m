Perhaps longer term we could move affinity mask creation from the irq
subsystem into a more generic library. Interrupts aren't the only
resource that want to spread across CPUs. For example, blk-mq has it's
own implementation to for polled queues, so I think a non-irq specific
implementation would be a nice addition to the kernel lib.
