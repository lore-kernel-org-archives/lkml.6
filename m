Fully agree. That is why this driver shares only the doorbell space. There is
only the doorbell is shared in the whole page, nothing else.

Maybe you are concerning the user driver will give malicious command to the
hardware? But these commands cannot influence the other process. If we can trust
the hardware design, the process cannot do any harm.

No, SVM is not the reason why we rely on Jean's SVM(SVA) series. We rely on
Jean's series because of multi-process (PASID or substream ID) support.

But of couse, WarpDrive can still benefit from the SVM feature.

Sorry, I'd got confuse here. I partially agree that the user driver is
redundance of kernel driver. (But for WarpDrive, the kernel driver is a full
driver include all preparation and setup stuff for the hardware, the user driver
is simply to send request and receive answer). Yes, it is just a choice of path.
But the user path is faster if the request come from use space. And to do that,
we need user land DMA support. Then why is it invaluable to let VFIO involved?

OK. Then let's call it SVM for now.
