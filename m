Yes, we could do this on init - this is actually how we do recovery

It is basically what we do in pblk now.

It is easy to abstract in core; I'm just concerned that hiding the chunk
metadata will end up making the pblk code more complex - in the end
doing a check on the version is meaningful for the reader.

Ok. Let's do it this way now and we can see how to abstract it when we
start implementing features based on these fields. The first one will be
wear levelling, which I expect to have for next window.
