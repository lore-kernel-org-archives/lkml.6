However many are needed to demonstrate that the new algorithm is needed.  E.g.
if your primary argument is that the new algorithm provides a better compression
ratio, than you'd need to show that simply choosing a higher compression level
with Zstandard or DEFLATE isn't good enough.

Not really true.  There are other situations where people need near-random
access to data so not too much can be compressed at once.  Also there are
applications where compression needs to be applied at the level of individual
packets or messages because e.g. the messages need to be sent over the network
right away to meet a time constraint.

A real flag would probably make more sense than an algorithm type.  Note that it
could also be meaningful for other algorithm types besides compression, e.g.
encryption algorithms.

Are you sure?  Just taking a random example I found in 2 minutes, in
decompress_rle() there is no validation that the destination buffer is not
overflowed, even though each 2 source bytes can expand into 128 destination
bytes.

Branch coverage is not enough.  You need to fuzz it with real fuzzers such as
afl-fuzz and libFuzzer.  It's 2018; there's no excuse for not doing so anymore
for code that is easily plugged into a fuzzer, e.g. decompression functions.
