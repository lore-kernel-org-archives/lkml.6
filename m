So you missed the main mailing lists for discussion of this kind of
thing, and the maintainer.  So I have reservations about the quality of
your due diligence already.

Looking at your description you are introducing a container id.
You don't descibe which namespace your contianer id lives in.
Without the container id living in a container this breaks
nested containers and process migration aka CRIU.

So based on the your description.
