I guess that would only happen if VFIO wanted to reserve IOVA regions
for its own use. But I don't see how that relates to the aperture

Those are good points in my opinion (assuming the new reserved regions
for aperture is done in the core API)

To be reliable though, userspace can't get the aperture from sysfs
reserved_regions, it will have to get it from VFIO. If a new application
expects the aperture to be described in reserved_regions but is running
under an old kernel, it will just assume a 64-bit aperture by mistake.
Unless we introduce a new IOMMU_RESV_* type to distinguish the aperture?

Another thing to note is that we're currently adding nested support to
VFIO for Arm and x86 archs. It requires providing low-level and
sometimes arch-specific information about the IOMMU to userspace,
information that is easier to describe using sysfs (e.g.
/sys/class/iommu/<iommu>/*) than a VFIO ioctl. Among them is the input
address size of the IOMMU, so we'll end up with redundant information in
sysfs on x86 and Arm sides, but that's probably harmless.

Thanks,
Jean
