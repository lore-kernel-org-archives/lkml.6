It does work, but it's a bit fragile. It requires duplicating the
dependencies of DYNAMIC_FTRACE in the 'if' condition.

Currently that's:

config DYNAMIC_FTRACE
	depends on FUNCTION_TRACER
	depends on HAVE_DYNAMIC_FTRACE

So technically we should use:

 	select DYNAMIC_FTRACE			if FUNCTION_TRACER and HAVE_DYNAMIC_FTRACE

Though we happen to know we just selected HAVE_DYNAMIC_FTRACE so we can
leave that out.

As long as the dependencies of DYNAMIC_FTRACE don't change, or the 'if'
clause is updated when they do, then it's OK and it is certainly simpler.

cheers
