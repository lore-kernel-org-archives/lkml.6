Once clang is in a state where it actually compiles a full-featured
kernel that can be subsequently booted, I'll definitely care about it,
and will make sure it doesn't break. In the meantime, I'm targeting GCC,
which is the only sane option for arm64 at the moment. Waiting for clang
to fixed is not an option.

Absolutely. Lack of GCC compatibility is what impairs the adoption of clang.

Which issue? Maybe it'd be worth reporting it?

To the original discussion about absolute addresses: I'm not so much
looking for additional testing (I trust that you've tested the patch
before sending it). I'm more after a statement from the LLVM folks
indicating in which conditions the compiler will emit absolute addresses
instead of PC-relative ones, and whether there is a way to make sure
that we always get the latter. If '-fno-jump-tables' is the only missing
flag, great. Otherwise, I'd like to know.

Thanks,
