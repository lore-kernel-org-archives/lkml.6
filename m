.. this is a problem.

If you ignore SPSR_EL3 you may deliver an SError to EL1 when the exception
interrupted EL2. Even if you setup the EL1 register correctly, EL1 can't eret to
EL2. This should never happen, SError is effectively masked if you are running
at an EL higher than the one its routed to.

More obviously: if the exception came from the EL that SError should be routed
to, but PSTATE.A was set, you can't deliver SError. Masking SError is the only
way the OS has to indicate it can't take an exception right now. VBAR_EL1 may be
'wrong' if we're doing some power-management, the FAR/ELR/ESR/SPSR registers may
contain live values that the OS would lose if you deliver another exception over
the top.

If you deliver an emulated-SError as the OS eret's, your new ELR will point at
the eret instruction and the CPU will spin on this instruction forever.

You have to honour the masking and routing rules for SError, otherwise no OS can
run safely with this firmware.

Yes, this is my suggestion of what to do if you can't deliver an SError: store
the RAS error in the BERT and 'reboot'.

(UEFI? I didn't think there was any of that at EL3, but I'm not familiar with
all the 'PI' bits).

The requirement is your emulated-SError from EL3 looks exactly like a
physical-SError as if EL3 wasn't implemented.
Your CPU has to handle cases where it can't deliver an SError, your emulation
has to do the same.

This is not something any OS can work around.
