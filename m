The way I figured this works is that it actually only applies to the
case where you're creating a user namespace as an unprivileged user. And
even in that case you will retain dumpability in two cases:
1. mapping userns id 0 to <my-unpriv-host-uid>
and any identity mapping, i.e.
2. mapping <my-unpriv-host-uid> to <my-unpriv-host-uid>

If you're creating a user namespace as root and set up mappings you
should always retain the dumpable flag (I might not be remembering all
corner-cases atm.) if you don't muck with capability sets and so on.
