_If_ I'm interpreting that correctly, that should be something like a bitmap
of attributes to modify + values to set for each.  Let's see -
	propagation	1 + 2 bits
	nodev		1 + 1
	noexec		1 + 1
	nosuid		1 + 1
	ro		1 + 1
	atime		1 + 3
That's 15 bits.  On top of that, we have 1 bit for "clone or original"
and 1 bit for "recursive or single-mount".  As well as AT_EMPTY_PATH,
and AT_NO_AUTOMOUNT (inconvenient, since these are fixed bits).  In
principle, that does fit into int, with some space to spare...

Is that what you have in mind?
