What system and what do you mean by "powered down"?  How much time
does it take for the battery to drain now?

First, reverting these is not an option or you will break systems
relying on them now.  4.13 is three releases back at this point.

Second, your issue appears to be related to the suspend/shutdown path
whereas commit 0ce3fcaff929 is mostly about resume, so presumably the
change in pci_enable_wake() causes the problem to happen.  Can you try
to revert this one alone and see if that helps?
