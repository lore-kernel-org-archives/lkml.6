blk_mq_flush_busy_ctxs() and blk_mq_dequeue_from_ctx() should work
fine in case of 'none' if per-domain list is added to ctx. Then we can make
none to be a bit fair on READ/WRITE.

The policy is done by IO scheduler, and you can just pick up request
from ctx/domain list easily by introducing one blk-mq core API.
