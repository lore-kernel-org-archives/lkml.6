Not all modems support all of the ModemManager location options;
-unmanaged is only for devices that support sending the data to a
separate port and for which we know the commands to do that.

It looks like QMI has a way to direct the output to a specific device:

// Enum to describe QMI PDS Output Devices
enum eQMIPDSOutputDevices:UINT8
{
   eQMIPDSOutputDevices_NoneDisabled  = 0,
   eQMIPDSOutputDevices_USB           = 1,
   eQMIPDSOutputDevices_UART1         = 2,
   eQMIPDSOutputDevices_UART2         = 3,
   eQMIPDSOutputDevices_SharedMemory  = 4,
};

so we could add support for that to libqmi and then to ModemManager,
which could help implement --location-enable-gps-unmanaged on alternate
ports.

But what might be simpler is implementing something like the "QMI GPS
proxy" that already exists, but for ModemManager or libqmi directly. 
That way you can use QMI and get known formatting of the output data,
but proxy it to a normal-looking NMEA tty?  Instead of trying to figure
out which TTY/UART/etc the information comes out of for each specific
device and somehow encoding that into the platform.  We know what the
QMI ports are already, that's easy.  We don't know what all the TTYs
are for every given modem and hardcoding that info somewhere is error-
prone and hard to keep up with.
