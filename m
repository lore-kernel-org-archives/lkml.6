Yes, definitely.  I intended to do that but got a little lazy.  What
do you think about the following?  Paul, if you haven't tested the
first patch, can you try this one instead?  The logic is pretty much
the same.

3461a068661c ("PCI: pciehp: Wait for hotplug command completion
lazily") mentions AMD and Nvidia devices with the same issue, but
unfortunately doesn't include any specifics.

    PCI: pciehp: Add quirk for Intel Command Completed erratum
    
    The Intel CF118 erratum means the controller does not set the Command
    Completed bit unless writes to the Slot Command register change "Control"
    bits.  Command Completed is never set for writes that only change software
    notification "Enable" bits.  This results in timeouts like this:
    
      pciehp 0000:00:1c.0:pcie004: Timeout on hotplug command 0x1038 (issued 65284 msec ago)
    
    When this erratum is present, avoid these timeouts by marking commands
    "completed" immediately unless they change the "Control" bits.
    
    Here's the text of the erratum from the Intel document:
    
      CF118        PCIe Slot Status Register Command Completed bit not always
                   updated on any configuration write to the Slot Control
                   Register
    
      Problem:     For PCIe root ports (devices 0 - 10) supporting hot-plug,
                   the Slot Status Register (offset AAh) Command Completed
                   (bit[4]) status is updated under the following condition:
                   IOH will set Command Completed bit after delivering the new
                   commands written in the Slot Controller register (offset
                   A8h) to VPP. The IOH detects new commands written in Slot
                   Control register by checking the change of value for Power
                   Controller Control (bit[10]), Power Indicator Control
                   (bits[9:8]), Attention Indicator Control (bits[7:6]), or
                   Electromechanical Interlock Control (bit[11]) fields. Any
                   other configuration writes to the Slot Control register
                   without changing the values of these fields will not cause
                   Command Completed bit to be set.
    
                   The PCIe Base Specification Revision 2.0 or later describes
                   the “Slot Control Register” in section 7.8.10, as follows
                   (Reference section 7.8.10, Slot Control Register, Offset
                   18h). In hot-plug capable Downstream Ports, a write to the
                   Slot Control register must cause a hot-plug command to be
                   generated (see Section 6.7.3.2 for details on hot-plug
                   commands). A write to the Slot Control register in a
                   Downstream Port that is not hotplug capable must not cause a
                   hot-plug command to be executed.
    
                   The PCIe Spec intended that every write to the Slot Control
                   Register is a command and expected a command complete status
                   to abstract the VPP implementation specific nuances from the
                   OS software. IOH PCIe Slot Control Register implementation
                   is not fully conforming to the PCIe Specification in this
                   respect.
    
      Implication: Software checking on the Command Completed status after
                   writing to the Slot Control register may time out.
    
      Workaround:  Software can read the Slot Control register and compare the
                   existing and new values to determine if it should check the
                   Command Completed status after writing to the Slot Control
                   register.
