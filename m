The question is whether we really need to dynamically patch the kernel
with ftrace to achieve what that patch does.

Furthermore, it would also be good to report what bugs we are actually
fixing, from what you are writing falling back to the current method if
!DYNAMIC_FTRACE_WITH_REGS is broken in many ways and I would start with
fixing the current behaviour with something that does not depend on arch
features that may not even be implemented.

Anyway - please CC me in in the follow up series, I am happy to help you
test it.

Thanks,
Lorenzo
