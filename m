OK, I missed where this was made about side effects of x and y, but I
suppose the idea was to use

  no_side_effects(x) && no_side_effects(y) ? trivial_max(x, y) :
old_max(x, y)

or the same thing spelled with b_c_e? Yes, I think that would work, if
we indeed had that way of checking an expression.

I don't think you should parenthesize bad, rather capitalize it. ({x++;
0;}) is constant in the eyes of __builtin_constant_p, but not
side-effect free. Sure, that's very contrived, but I can easily imagine
some max(f(foo), -1) call where f is sometimes an external function, but
for other .configs it's a static inline that always returns 0, but still
has some non-trivial side-effect before that. And this would all depend
on which optimizations gcc applies before it decides to evaluate
builtin_constant_p, so could be some fun debugging. Good thing that that
didn't work out...

Yeah, I think the closest is a five year old suggestion
(https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57612) to add a
__builtin_assert_no_side_effects, that could be used in macros that for
some reason cannot be implemented without evaluating some argument
multiple times. It would be more useful to have the predicate version,
which one could always turn into a build bug version. But we have
neither, unfortunately.
