On a powerpc embedded board which has an mpc8xx processor running at 
133Mhz, I now get the startup done in more than 7 minutes instead of 30 
seconds. This is due to the webserver blocking on read on /dev/random 
until we get 'random: crng init done':

[    0.000000] Linux version 4.17.0-rc4-00415-gd2f75d40072d

16:32:02 CEST 2018
[    0.295453] random: get_random_u32 called from

This has become really critical, is there anything that can be done ?
