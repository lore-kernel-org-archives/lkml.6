It's reduced in cases where the number of possible CPUs is way larger than
the number of online CPUs.

Now, if you look at the number of present CPUs on such systems it's
probably the same as the number of online CPUs.

It only differs on machines which support physical hotplug, but that's not
the normal case. Those systems are more special and less wide spread.

So the obvious simple fix for this regression issue is to spread out the
vectors accross present CPUs and not accross possible CPUs.

I'm not sure if there is a clear indicator whether physcial hotplug is
supported or not, but the ACPI folks (x86) and architecture maintainers
should be able to answer that question. I have a machine which says:

   smpboot: Allowing 128 CPUs, 96 hotplug CPUs

There is definitely no way to hotplug anything on that machine and sure the
existing spread algorithm will waste vectors to no end.

Sure then there is virt, which can pretend to have a gazillion of possible
hotpluggable CPUs, but virt is an insanity on its own. Though someone might
come up with reasonable heuristics for that as well.

Thoughts?

Thanks,
