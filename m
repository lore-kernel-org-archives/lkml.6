On powerpc, all platform devices get a dma mask. But they don't do that in 
drivers/base/platform.c, they use arch_setup_pdev_archdata(). Why didn't 
they take the approach you suggest?

How would I support the claim that replacing an empty platform device dma 
mask with 0xffffffff is safe on all architectures and platforms?

Is there no code conditional upon dev.coherent_dma_mask or dev.dma_mask 
that could misbehave? (Didn't I cite an example in the other thread?*)

If you can convince me that it is safe, I'd be happy to submit the patch 
you asked for.

For now, I still think that patching the platform driver was the correct 
patch*.

Maybe the real problem is your commit 205e1b7f51e4 ("dma-mapping: warn 
when there is no coherent_dma_mask"), because it assumes that all dma_ops 
implementations care about coherent_dma_mask.

The dma_map_ops implementations that do use coherent_dma_mask should 
simply fail when it is unset, right?

Would it not be better to revert your patch and fix the dma_map_ops 
failure paths, than to somehow audit all the platform drivers and patch 
drivers/base/platform.c?

Thanks.
