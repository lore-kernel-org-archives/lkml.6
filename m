Thanks for the clarification.

Is the 5% a reasonable estimate or more a ballpark number? I find it a
bit strange to require 3TB of memory to boot a kernel just to dump the
crashed kernel image. Shouldn't you rather look into this estimate than
spreading ZONE_MOVABLE abuse? Larger systems need more memory to dump
even with the regular kexec kdump but I have never seen any to use more
than 1G or something like that.
