Legacy VGA also falls into this category - for example
drivers/video/console/vgacon.c will happily use outb/inb macros to hard
coded addresses which are hoped to be present on some PCI/ISA bus.

With regards to ISA drivers - take a look for anything that registers with
isa_register_driver - for example:

drivers/input/touchscreen/htcpen.c
drivers/net/ethernet/3com/3c509.c
drivers/watchdog/ebc-c384_wdt.c

None of these drivers do any kind of mapping before attempting to access
these addresses.

Thanks,

Andrew Murray
