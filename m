I am honestly very confused. First off, I do not understand what this
patch really does (or better what DW can't do so that it needs a
specific configfs string and therefore a specific configuration).

What's the purpose of the linkup notifier ? What does it mean that
the DW HW can't handle it ?

Are we referring to the pci_epf_linkup() function ?

If it is a HW configuration (ie the DW HW does not have a signal to
report that the link is up ?) its enablement must depend on HW
controller properties not configfs entries, I do not like what this
patch does (probably because I am confused and I do not understand it).

Please let me know your thoughts on this, thanks.
