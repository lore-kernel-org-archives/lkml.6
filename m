OK so you're saying that if CONFIG_IMA_APPRAISE_FIRMWARE is disabled you can
still end up with CONFIG_CFG80211_REQUIRE_SIGNED_REGDB as enabled *and* a
custom policy which requires IMA-appraisal for the certain firmware signature
verifications?

I'm not too familiar with IMA however it sounds like you can extend the IMA
built-in policy on the boot command line. If so I'll note MODULE_FIRMWARE()
macro is typically used to annotate firmware description -- not all drivers use
this though for a few reasons, for instance once is that some names are
constructed dynamically at run time. Consider how some drivers rev firmware
with versions, and as they do this they want to keep certain features only for
certain firmware versions. Despite this lack of a direct 1-1 mapping for all
firmwares needed, I *believe* one current use case for this macro is to extract
required firmwares needed on early boot so they can be stashed into the
initramfs if you have these modules enabled on the initramfs. Dracut folks
can confirm but -- dracut *seems* broken then given the semantic gap I
mentioned above.

dracut-init.sh:    for _fw in $(modinfo -k $kernel -F firmware $1 2>/dev/null); do

If I read this correctly this just complains if the firmware file is
missing if the module is installed on initramfs and the firmware file
is not present. If so we have a current semantic gap and modules with
dynamic names are not handled. And its unclear which modules would be
affected. This is a not a big issue for dracut though since not all drivers
strive to be included on initramfs, unless their storage I suppose -- not
sure how common these storage drivers are for initramfs with dynamic firmware
names which do *not* use MODULE_FIRMWARE().

While the idea of MODULE_FIRMWARE() may need to be given some love or adjusted
to incorporate globs / regexps to fix this existing gap, or we come up with
something more reliable, if fixed, it in theory could end up being re-used to
enable you to extract and build policies for firmware signing at build time...

Sure, it is still unclear to me if CONFIG_IMA_APPRAISE_FIRMWARE will be
doing firmware verification in userspace or in the kernel.

nit: To be clear I was not stating options, I was stating premises to
justify my recommendations.

Oh I agree, Linux enterprise distributions also have a strong reason to
have this, so that for instance we only trust and run vendor-approved
signed firmware. Otherwise the driver should reject the firmware. Every
now and then enterprise distros may run into cases were certain customers
may run oddball firmwares, and its unclear if we expect proper functionality
with that firmware. Having some form of firmware signing would help with
this pipeline, but this is currently dealt with at the packaging, and
noting other than logs ensures the driver is using an intended firmware.
But these needs *IMHO* have not been enough to push to generalize a kernel
firmware signing facility.

If CONFIG_IMA_APPRAISE_FIRMWARE is going to provide this functionality somehow
I'm happy to hear it.

Yes, this sounds fine.

But I'm also saying we can *live* with them if they are wrapped in #ifdefs with
functions sot hat when something is not required they are a no-op. Ideally if
we could avoid this it would be great and it seems you're saying its possible.
Keeping the #ifdefs with function wrappers would make sense as a trade-off if we
really are going to make toss firmware under CONFIG_IMA_APPRAISE_FIRMWARE and
want to review carefully the addition of new open coded firmware solutions (as
the regulatory.db work).
