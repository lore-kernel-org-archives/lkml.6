If a bridge, e.g., a Root Port in your case, is in D3hot, we should be
able to access config space of the bridge itself, but the secondary
bus will be in B2 or B3 and we won't be able to access config space
for any devices below the bridge.  This is true for *all* bridges, not
just this Cavium Root Port.

The PCIe r4.0, sec 5.3.1, implementation note seems relevant:

  When a Type 1 Function associated with a Switch/Root Port (a
  "virtual bridge") is in a non-D0 power state, it will emulate the
  behavior of a conventional PCI bridge in its handling of Memory,
  I/O, and Configuration Requests and Completions. ...  All Type 1
  Configuration Requests are terminated as Unsupported Requests, ...

That appears to require an NDA, so that doesn't work for me.  Can you
just include the erratum text in the changelog?

This isn't exactly relevant because it says requests *other than*
config and message requests must be handled as Unsupported Requests,
and we're talking about a config request.  I think sec 5.3.1 is more
to the point: the Root Port sees a Type 1 Configuration Request that
would be forwarded to its secondary interface if the port were in D0,
and that request should be terminated as an Unsupported Request.

I think the question is how the Root Complex turns this Unsupported
Request into some signal to the CPU.  The implementation note in 2.3.2
might be relevant:

  Some system configuration software depends on reading a data value
  of all 1’s when a Configuration Read Request is terminated as an
  Unsupported Request, particularly when probing to determine the
  existence of a device in the system. A Root Complex intended for use
  with software that depends on a read-data value of all 1’s must
  synthesize this value when UR Completion Status is returned for a
  Configuration Read Request.

So maybe the erratum is that the RC was intended to synthesize all 1's
but it doesn't?

There are other cases that can result in Unsupported Request
completions, so my fear is that this change will take care of one such
case but leave others that will cause similar unhandled external
aborts.

I should have asked this before: why are we even trying to do this
config read to a device that's in D3?  I assume this root port started
out in D0 because we apparently enumerated it successfully, but it
must have been put into D3 later?

The pci_probe_reset_function() function comment says "the PCI device
must be responsive to PCI config space in order to use this function." 
So apparently the caller should make sure the device is in at least
D3hot and any bridges leading to it are in D0.

If we're missing whatever it is that makes sure the target device is
reachable and responsive to config space, we likely have issues on
other systems as well.  On Cavium this causes the external abort, but
on other systems, we'd probably just get all 1's data back from the
config read and silently do the wrong thing in
pci_probe_reset_function().

I don't know how this runtime PM works, but maybe Rafael can help us
out.
