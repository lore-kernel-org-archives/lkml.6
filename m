Do you mean "is always allocated"?

This is the one I'm questioning.

I agree on this totally. :)

Why not?  You could pretty easily get a thread going that had its stack
covered with another pkey and that was being very careful what it
accesses.  It could pretty easily set pkey-0's access or write-disable bits.

I don't think this is necessary.  I think the only rule we *need* is:

	pkey-0 is allocated implicitly at execve() time.  You do not
	need to call pkey_alloc() to allocate it.

I don't understand what you are saying here.
