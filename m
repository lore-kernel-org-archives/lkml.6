Well, the summary is right there in the changelog: Kernel code simply should
not pretend to be userspace and call a syscall function. For a more
detailled description, see, for instance, Linus' explanation in
http://lkml.kernel.org/r/CA+55aFwo7yA1gm8AUYMEQA8ZNY-9GGF8Oup09jJFvEa4J7C+jA@mail.gmail.com :

| On x86-64, we'd like to just pass the 'struct pt_regs *' pointer, and
| have the sys_xyz() function itself just pick out the arguments it
| needs from there.
|
| That has a few reasons for it:
| 
| - we can clear all registers at system call entry, which helps defeat
| some of the "pass seldom used register with user-controlled value that
| survives deep into the callchain" things that people used to leak
| information
| 
|  - we can streamline the low-level system call code, which needs to
| pass around 'struct pt_regs *' anyway, and the system call only picks
| up the values it actually needs

I can add such a long description to all these patches, but that seems to
be a bit... longwinded.

Thanks,
