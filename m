That really shouldn't be an issue. Just about every PC up to a few years
ago has something that at least looks like a PCIe to PCI bridge on it
somewhere (or buried in the chipset) to handle the PCI slots. There are
also a vast number of older PCIe cards that are in fact PCI devices glued
to PCIe x1 this way (or by worse things) in the market.

Yes it can do that.

The hardware generates INTA-INTD, your bridge should turn those into the
in band PCIe messages for INTA-INTD. The IRQ 'number' is just a
configuration construct, and in fact it's very much a *PC* BIOS one.

However pci_assign_irq does always update the INTERRUPT_LINE register
because it has to do so for certain 'fake PCI' environments (like some
old VIA chipsets) where the INTERRUPT_LINE is used for IRQ routing magic
internally.

Anyway it shouldn't matter!

Armwavingly 'generic' vs 'platform specific'. If you look at a modern
kernel you'll find pci_assign_irq deals with all of this and does update
the LINE register. 3.10 is five years old (I actually had hair when it
came out) so this is really the wrong place to worry about ancient
computing history.

Yes.

Do you see the same problem with a current 4.x kernel ? If you then it's
definitely worth further discussion (and I've added linux-pci to the cc),
if it works fine in 4.14, then I'd stick your hack in the Red Hat driver,
and remember its not something anyone is too likely to fix there.
