Right.  This is a historical misnomer.

My plan is, as already posted below, to rename 'silentoldconfig' to 'synconfig'
https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/1/17/1359

Good catch.

No.  NACK.

silentoldconfig touches include/generated/autoconf.h
so, files that depend on it will be re-compiled, unnecessarily.


silentoldconfig ( 'syncconfig' in a more proper name)
should be run only when necessary.
