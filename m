Ok, I'll fix that up.

I could at least add a note to see the comment in dm_dax_dev_claim().
The filesystem caller expects to get a dax_dev back or NULL from
fs_dax_claim_bdev() if the claim failed. For fs_dax_claim() the return
value could simply be bool for pass / fail, but I used dax_dev NULL /
not-NULL instead.

In the case of device-mapper the claim attempt can't fail for
conflicting ownership reasons because the exclusive ownership of the
underlying block device is already established by device-mapper before
the fs claims the device-mapper dax device.

Oh, yeah, I like that better. I'll just make it return void and have
dm_dax_fs_claim() return the dax_dev directly.

Thanks Mike!
