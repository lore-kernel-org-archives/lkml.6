Yes, I agree with you!

Other options look much better than this one!

This one looks promising, One Question though..

Do we expect that there would be nvmem cells in any of the partitions?
or
nvmem cell are only valid for unpartioned area?

Am sure that the nvmem cells would be in multiple partitions, Is it okay 
to have some parts of partition to be in a separate subnode?

I would like this case to be considered too.

This looks much cleaner! We could hook that up under 
__nvmem_device_get() to do that translation.

Option 2 looks better than this.

Overall am still not able to clear visualize on how MTD bindings with 
nvmem cells would look in both partition and un-partition usecases?
An example DT would be nice here!!

Option 4 looks like much generic solution to me, may be we should try 
this once bindings on MTD side w.r.t nvmem cells are decided.
