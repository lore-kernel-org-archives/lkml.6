Thanks for your submission. I had started reviewing it over a week
ago, but never
completed since I was travelling in the meantime. I've completed my first pass
now and will wait for a new version before I take a more detailed look.

Overall, it looks nice, but changing the rest of the system call interface will
take a while, this includes several points I've mentioned already, but
to clarify,
every file in arch/csky/include/uapi/asm/ needs to be carefully reviewed to
contain only the minimum required additions to the asm-generic version.

Changing the ABI will obviously get in the way of testing, but this should
be over as soon as the port is merged.

Another interesting question is the status of your toolchain support. I see your
github account contains binutils and gcc repositories, but they are not upstream
yet. Are you working on getting those included in the respective upstream
projects already?
