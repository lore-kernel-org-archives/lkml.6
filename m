Sorry, I have confused the HW default value and the read value of BAR
size. The hardware default value is 0xffff_ffff_0000_000c, it's a 64-bit
BAR with prefetchable range.

When we start to decoding the BAR, the read value of BAR0 at 0x10 is
0x0c, and the value at 0x14 is 0xffff_ffff, so the read value of BAR
size is 0xffff_ffff_0000_0000, which will be decoded to 0xffff_ffff, and
it will be set to the end value of BAR0 resource in the pci_dev.

The BAR size is calculated by the code (res->end - res->start + 1) is
fine, I think it's a hardware defect because that we can not change the
hardware default value or just disable it since we don't using it.

The BAR0 resource value in the pci_dev is depend on the hardware value,
it can be cleared out after all devices have been scanned, but we should
set it's size bigger than MMIO space, so the software will think it's a
invalid resource and won't assign a resource for it.
