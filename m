Huh? Regardless of which virtio devices use it or not, the DMA API is 
handling the SEV case as correctly as it possibly can, by forcing 
everything through the unencrypted bounce buffer. If the segments being 
mapped are too big for that bounce buffer in the first place, there's 
nothing it can possibly do except fail, gracefully or otherwise.

Now, in theory, yes, the real issue at hand is not unique to virtio-blk 
nor SEV - any driver whose device has a sufficiently large DMA segment 
size and who manages to get sufficient physically-contiguous memory 
could technically generate a scatterlist segment longer than SWIOTLB can 
handle. However, in practice that basically never happens, not least 
because very few drivers ever override the default 64K DMA segment 
limit. AFAICS nothing in drivers/virtio is calling 
dma_set_max_seg_size() or otherwise assigning any dma_parms to replace 
the defaults either, so the really interesting question here is how are 
these apparently-out-of-spec 256K segments getting generated at all?

Robin.
