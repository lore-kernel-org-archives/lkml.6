It wasn't, but your answer is enlightening!  I've read the SGX
*manual*, but I hadn't dug through the actual Intel-supplied enclaves.
So, when I said that the LE isn't an important part of the overall
trust model, I meant that it isn't *in hardware*.  It's certainly
possible to write SGX software that weakens the security of the
overall system, and Intel seems to have done so:

This seems entirely reasonable.  (But see below...)

...and this seems entirely unreasonable.  Your description does indeed
appear consistent with the code: the PCE will hand out the PPID to any
requesting enclave that has the PROVISION bit set, so you are correct
that:

But here's where the whole thing goes off the rails.  I would argue
that the Intel-supplied (and Intel-signed, apparently!) PCE is just
straight-up buggy.  What Intel is *trying* to do is to hand out the
PPID to an appropriately signed enclave.  What they actually did is to
hand out the PPID to any enclave that has the PROVISION bit set.  This
is poor design because it overload the PROVISION bit.  That bit is
supposed to mean "may use EGETKEY to obtain provisioning and
provisioning seal keys", which is not actually what Intel wants here.
It's also poor design without FLC because it pointlessly relies on the
LE to enforce a restriction on the use of provisioning enclaves, when
the code could instead have checked MRSIGNER..  And it's just straight
up wrong with FLC because there is no guarantee whatsoever that the LE
being used is Intel's.  And, for that matter, there is no guarantee
that the requesting enclave doesn't have the DEBUG bit set.

(It's also poor design because the PCE doesn't appear to verify that
the report passed in is actually intended to be associated with a call
to get_ppid().  There appear to be reports associated with provision
"msg1" and "msg3".  If it's possible to get a valid report for msg3 to
be accepted as a msg1 report of vice versa, then it might be game
over.)

Sorry, but this is not Linux's problem.  The right fix is, in my
opinion, entirely clear: the PCE should check MRSIGNER and possibly
even MRENCLAVE in the report it receives.  Intel needs to fix their
PCE, sign a fixed version, and find some way to revoke, to the extent
possible, the old one.  And the SGX enclave authors need to understand
something that is apparently subtle: THE LAUNCH POLICY IS NOT PART OF
THE TCB AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON.  Enclaves can and should be
written to remain secure even in the complete absence of any form of
launch control.

I went and filed a bug on github.  Let's see what happens:

https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx/issues/345

Also, the whole SGX report mechanism seems to be misused in the SDK.
An SGX report is a cryptographic primitive that essentially acts like
a signed blob.  Building a secure protocol on top of signed messages
or on top of reports takes more than just making up ad hoc blob
formats and signing them.  There needs to be domain separation between
different messages, and this seems to be entirely missing.  Do you
know if Intel has had a serious audit of their platform enclave code
done?

I'm referring to the hardware's policy as to when keys that don't
depend on OWNEREPOCH can be obtained.  As far as I know, the only real
need for such keys is to verify that the running platform is a real
Intel platform, which means that access to the provisioning key is
only useful to Intel-approved services.  Why didn't Intel enforce this
in hardware or microcode?  I see no reason that EGETKEY should hand
out those key types of the enclave is not signed by Intel.  For that
matter, I also don't see why the provisioning seal key needs to exist
-- the regular seal key could be used instead and, if OWNEREPOCH
changes, the platform could just re-certify itself.

That's what you get for reading my unfinished email :)

Your proposal fails to protect against SGX malware.  Here's an SGX
malware use case: the attacker writes a malicious enclave and gets a
victim machine to run it as a non-root user.  They bundle it with a
valid Intel-signed copy of the relevant platform enclaves and use them
to bootstrap the attestation process.  The malicious enclave attests
its identity to a command-and-control server and obtains malicious
code to run.  The good guys can't reverse engineer the malware
enclave, because they can't pass the attestation check and therefore
can't obtain the encrypted code.

This isn't prevented by your proposed solution: the provisioning
enclaves are all signed by Intel.  What's needed is a check that
prevents unauthorized *users* from running them.
