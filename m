The purpose was to have a clean usage base after the conversion. If we
are growing a non-trivial use base which wants to use GFP_NOWAIT semantic
then sure we can make kvmalloc never fallback to vmallock. But see
below...

... Well, there are users who would like to use kvmalloc for
GFP_NOFS/GFP_NOIO context. Do we want them to fail more likely for
larger order rather than have them fixed (to either drop the NOFS
because it just has been blindly copied from a different code without
too much thinking or use the scope NOFS/NOIO API)? A warn_on tends to be
rather harsh but effective way to push maintainers fix their broken
code...
