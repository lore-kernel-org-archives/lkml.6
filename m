I had originally tied it to BLK_SCSI_REQUEST. Logically speaking,
sense buffers are part of the request, and the CONFIG work is already
done. This is roughly what I tried to do before, since scsi_ioctl.c is
the only code pulled in for CONFIG_BLK_SCSI_REQUEST:

$ git grep BLK_SCSI_REQUEST | grep Makefile
block/Makefile:obj-$(CONFIG_BLK_SCSI_REQUEST)   += scsi_ioctl.o

Should I move to code to a new drivers/scsi/scsi_sense.c and add it to
drivers/scsi/Makefile as:

obj-$(CONFIG_BLK_SCSI_REQUEST)    += scsi_sense.o

Every place I want to use the code is already covered by
CONFIG_BLK_SCSI_REQUEST, so it seems like I just need to know where to
put the .c file. :P
