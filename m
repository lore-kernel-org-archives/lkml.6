I'd prefer dm_dax_iterate() be renamed to dm_dax_iterate_devices()

But dm_dax_iterate() is weird... it is simply returning the struct
dax_device *dax_dev that is passed: seemingly without actually directly
changing anything about that dax_device (I can infer that you're
claiming the underlying devices, but...)

In general user's of ti->type->iterate_devices can get a result back
(via 'int' return).. you aren't using it that way (and maybe dax will
never have a need to return an answer).  But all said, I think I'd
prefer to see dm_dax_iterate_devices() return void.

But please let me know if I'm missing something, thanks.

Mike
