Subject: [PATCH v4 00/17] arm64: Add SMCCC v1.1 support and CVE-2017-5715 (Spectre variant 2) mitigation

ARM has recently published a SMC Calling Convention (SMCCC)
specification update[1] that provides an optimised calling convention
and optional, discoverable support for mitigating CVE-2017-5715. ARM
Trusted Firmware (ATF) has already gained such an implementation[2].

This series addresses a few things:

- It provides a KVM implementation of PSCI v1.0, which is a
  prerequisite for being able to discover SMCCC v1.1.

- It allows KVM to advertise SMCCC v1.1, which is de-facto supported
  already (it never corrupts any of the guest registers).

- It implements KVM support for the ARCH_WORKAROUND_1 function that is
  used to mitigate CVE-2017-5715 in a guest (if such mitigation is
  available on the host).

- It implements SMCCC v1.1 and ARCH_WORKAROUND_1 discovery support in
  the kernel itself.

- It finally provides firmware callbacks for CVE-2017-5715 for both
  kernel and KVM and drop the initial PSCI_GET_VERSION based
  mitigation.

Patch 1 is already merged, and included here for reference. Patches on
top of arm64/for-next/core. Tested on Seattle and Juno, the latter
with ATF implementing SMCCC v1.1.

* From v3:
  - Dropped KVM PSCI version selection API for the time being, planning
  to resend it after -rc1
  - Some minor cleanups
  - Collected Acks, TBs and RBs.

* From v2:
  - Fixed SMC handling in KVM
  - PSCI fixes and tidying up
  - SMCCC primitive rework for better code generation (both efficiency
  and correctness)
  - Remove PSCI_GET_VERSION as a mitigation vector

* From v1:
  - Fixed 32bit build
  - Fix function number sign extension (Ard)
  - Inline SMCCC v1.1 primitives (cpp soup)
  - Prevent SMCCC spamming on feature probing
  - Random fixes and tidying up
