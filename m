So, where do we go from here?

Either Linus and Andrew like the mincore() return value tweak, or this 
could be further discussed (*). But in either of the cases, I think 
patches 1 and 2 should be at least queued for 5.1.

(*) I'd personally include it as well, as I don't see how it would break 
    anything, it's pretty straightforward, and brings back some sanity to
    mincore() return value.
