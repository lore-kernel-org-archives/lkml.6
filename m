It depends.

In general, the irqchip implementing set_affinity is the one talking to
the MSI controller directly.

A lot of drivers don't implement it because they are multiplexing a
number of MSIs on a single interrupt. The consequence is that you cannot
change the affinity of a single MSI without affecting them all.

HW that is build this way makes it impossible to implement one of the
main feature of MSIs, which is to have per-cpu interrupts. Oh well. They
probably also miss on the "MSI as a memory barrier" semantics...

Decent HW doesn't do any multiplexing, and thus can very easily
implement set_affinity.

The other model (which x86 is using, for example), is to have one
doorbell per CPU. In this model, changing affinity is just a matter of
changing the doorbell address.

> Does setting affinity to MSI needs any support from GIC?

Absolutely. If using GICv2m, you need to change the affinity at the
distributor level. With GICv3 and the ITS, you need to emit a MOVI
command to target another redistributor.

> Setting affinity can be achieved only with hardware support ?

See above. It depends which signalling model you're using, and how well
it has been implemented.

Thanks,
