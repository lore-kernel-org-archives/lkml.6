No. On the contrary I think my patch unable to exploit the possible
race window.  From a technical point of view, Thiago's patch does the
right things

  - It waits for the target CPU to come out of CEDE and set its state
    to CPU_STATE_OFFLINE.
  
  - Only then it then makes the "query-cpu-stopped-state" rtas call in
    a loop, while giving sufficient delay between successive
    queries. This reduces the unnecessary rtas-calls.

In my patch, I don't do any of this, but simply keep calling
"query-cpu-stopped-state" call in a loop for 4000 iterations.

That said, if I incorporate the wait for the target CPU to set its
state to CPU_STATE_OFFLINE in my patch and then make the
"query-cpu-stopped-state" rtas call, then, even I am able to get the
crash with the "RTAS CALL BUFFER CORRUPTION" message.

I think that incorporating the wait for the target CPU set its state
to CPU_STATE_OFFLINE increases the probability that
"query-cpu-stopped-state" and "stop-self" rtas calls get called more
or less at the same time. However since concurrent invocations of
these rtas-calls is allowed by the PAPR, it should not result in a
"RTAS CALL BUFFER CORRUPTION". Am I missing something here ?

IMHO, if the race-window exists, it would be better to confirm and fix
it, given that we have a patch that can exploit it consistently.
