sounds acceptable, though a bit long (especially for the compat case, though
it doesn't really matter in the case of 
__inline_compat_sys_sched_rr_get_interval)

Error injection is unrelated. It seems to be for three reasons, if I read
the code (include/linux/syscalls.h) correctly:

	asmlinkage long __do_sys##name(__MAP(x,__SC_LONG,__VA_ARGS__))

1)  This takes arguments of type long (to protect against CVE-2009-0029);
    see https://lwn.net/Articles/604287/ : "Digging into the history of
    this, it turns out that the long version ensures that 32-bit values
    are correctly sign-extended for some 64-bit kernel platforms,
    preventing a historical vulnerability."

	{
		long ret = __in_sys##name(__MAP(x,__SC_CAST,__VA_ARGS__));
		__MAP(x,__SC_TEST,__VA_ARGS__);

2) We can add testing whether one of the arguments is longer than long.

		__PROTECT(x, ret,__MAP(x,__SC_ARGS,__VA_ARGS__));

3) This adds asmlinkage_protect() on m68k, but seems to be a no-op on other
architectures.


While reasons 1 and 3 seem irrelevant on x86, I'd like to keep the code
close to the generic one -- and reason 2 is valid in and by itself. So I'd
recommend keeping the __inline_sys / __do_sys indirection.


> Is UML unaffected by these renames?

UML is only affected by patch 3/3, but kept happy by the patch to
entry/syscalls/syscalltbl.sh.


On a somewhat related note: I'll try to prepare a patch this evening which
lets us build just the __ia32_sys and __x32_compat_sys stubs we actually
need. We have that information already in entry/syscalls/syscall_{32,64}.tbl,
it just needs to be extracted into another header file (in the form of
	#define NEED_IA32_sys_xyzzz 1
) and then tested within the stubs. After some randconfig testing, this
might be worthwile to add on top of the patches already in tip-asm and the
three renaming patches currently under discussion.


Thanks,
	Dominik
