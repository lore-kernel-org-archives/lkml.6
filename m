Yes, we've been specifically prohibiting all cases where these pages get 
passed to userspace. We don't want that. Although it works in limited 
cases (ie x86), and we use it for some testing, there are dragons there.

No similar issues on arm64. Any chance you could simply not map the PCI 
bars that way? What's the point of that? It may simply mean ppc64 can't 
be supported until either that changes or the kernel infrastructure gets 
more sophisticated.

It's not so much the DMA map API as it is the entire kernel 
infrastructure. Scatter lists (which are universally used to setup DMA 
requests) require pages and bios require pages, etc, etc. In fact, this 
patch set, in its current form, routes around the DMA API entirely.

Myself[1] and others have done prototype work to migrate away from 
struct pages and to use pfn_t instead but this work doesn't seem to get 
very far in the community.
