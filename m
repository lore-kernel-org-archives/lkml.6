In order to support book3s/32, I needed to add arguments to the 
unlock/lock functions, as the address is needed to identify the affected 
segments.

Therefore, I changed it to single functions as you suggested. These 
functions have 'to', 'from' and 'size' arguments. When it is a read, 
'to' is NULL. When it is a write, 'from' is NULL. When it is a copy, 
none is NULL.

See RFC v2 for the details.
