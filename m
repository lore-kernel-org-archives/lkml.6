Ignoring for a moment whether or not the audit container ID is
applicable here, one of the things I've been focused on with the audit
container ID work is trying to make it difficult for other subsystems
to use it.  I've taken this stance not because I don't think something
like a container ID would be useful outside the audit subsystem, but
rather because I'm afraid of how it might be abused by other
subsystems and that abuse might threaten the existence of the audit
container ID.

If there is a willingness to implement a general kernel container ID
that behaves similarly to how the audit container ID is envisioned,
I'd much rather do that then implement something which is audit
specific.
