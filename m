Question to whom ? The caller can ask for it - but the problem here is generic dma 
API code is clearing out GFP_ZERO and expecting arch code to memst unconditionally 
- is that expected of arch code - and is documented ?

That is broken to begin with - arch dma_alloc* simply passes thru gfp flags to 
page allocator and doesn't muck around with them. We could in theory but doesn't 
seem like the right thing to do IMO.
