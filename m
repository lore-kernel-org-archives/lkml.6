Hey Kees,

Thanks for taking a look!

I replied in the other thread
(https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/cover/872938/#1856642 for those
following along at home), but no, at least not that I know of.

Because the fd is for a filter, not a task.

Yes, exactly. The cookie just adds uniqueness, and as Andy pointed out
if we switch to u64, the race above basically ("u64 should be enough
for anybody") goes away.

I suggested netlink in LA, and everyone (especially Andy) groaned very
loudly :). I'm happy to switch it to netlink if you like, although i
think memcpy() of structs should be safe here, since the return value
from read or write can indicate the size of things.

Sure, but as long as the manager copies the relevant arguments out of
the tracee's memory *before* evaluating whether it's safe to do the
thing the tracee wants to do, it's ok. The assumption here is that the
tracee can't corrupt the manager's memory (because if it could, lots
of other things would already be broken).

Yes, I didn't exactly know what to do here. ERRNO, TRAP, and KILL all
seemed more important than USER_NOTIF, but TRACE didn't. I don't have
a strong opinion about what to do here, because users can adjust their
filters accordingly. Let me know what you prefer.

A reasonable question. I'm happy to do that as a separate series
before this one goes in if you want.

I'm not sure I follow. If the user passes in an old (smaller) struct
seccomp_notif_resp, we don't want to copy more than they specified. If
they pass in a bigger one, this will be sizeof(resp).

Yep, exactly.

I'm not really sure how we prevent multiple readers/writers of the fd.
But even with a single writer, the case you described "could" happen
(although again, with u64 cookies it shouldn't be a problem).

I'm not sure how ordering helps us though; the problem is really that
one entry for a pid was deleted, and a whole new one was created. So
ordering will look ok, but the response will go to the wrong pid.

Nothing, I just didn't implement it. I will do so for v2.

Ugh, yes. For the SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_GET_LISTENER case, you're right.
Originally I only had the ptrace-based one, and that has a get() in
get_nth_filter(), so the comment makes sense in that case.

I'll straighten this out for v2 and

Is there some better way to generate magic numbers? :)
