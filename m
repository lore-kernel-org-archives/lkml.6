The rest of the kernel documentation calls them "tagged pointers", and
doesn't use "top byte ignore", for example

I'll amend this to:

"This uses instructions in the HINT space (unless -march=armv8.3-a or
higher is also passed), and such code can run on systems without the
pointer authentication extension."

Mostly, yes. If the guest leaves SCTLR_EL1.EnIA unset (and
EnIB/EnDA/EnDB), then PAC* and AUT* instructions in the HINT space will
execute as NOPs. If the guest sets EnIA, then PAC*/AUT* instructions
will trap and KVM will inject an "Unknown reason" exception into the
guest (which will cause a Linux guest to send a SIGILL to the application).

In the latter case we could instead pretend the instruction was a NOP
and not inject an exception, but trapping twice per every function would
probably be terrible for performance. The guest shouldn't be setting
EnIA anyway if ID_AA64ISAR1_EL1 reports that pointer authentication is
not present (because KVM has hidden it).

The other special case is the XPACLRI instruction, which is also in the
HINT space. Currently it will trap and KVM will inject an exception into
the guest. We should probably change this to NOP instead, as that's what
applications will expect. Unfortunately there is no EnIA-like control to
make it NOP.

One option is for KVM to pretend the instruction was a NOP and return to
the guest. But if XPACLRI gets executed frequently, then the constant
trapping might hurt performance. I don't know how frequently it might
get used, as I don't know of any applications currently using it. From
what I understand, it may be used by userspace stack unwinders.

(Also worth noting - as far as I can tell there is no easy way for KVM
to know which pointer authentication instruction caused the trap, so we
may have to do something unusual like use "at s12e1r" to read guest
memory and check for XPACLRI.)

The other option is to turn off trapping entirely. However then on a
big.LITTLE system with mismatched pointer authentication support
instructions will work intermittently on some CPUs but not others.

Thoughts?
