Thanks for your review!

I guess I can split it into a separate patch if you like.  Hopefully it
can still go in through the NFS tree so we need to sync separate trees.

I could, yes.  But that was true before the patch as well.  I don't
really want to change things that I don't need to change.
This is really a style issue.  If Trond or Anna prefer the variable in
the most local scope, I'll move it.

There are two lists, a per "struct nfs_client" list of "struct
nfs_server", and a per "struct nfs_server" list of "struct
nfs_delegation".

I expect that grabbing the inode will stop the filesystem from being
unmounted, so that nfs_server will remain in the list from the
nfs_client.

Also I expect that grabbing the inode will mean that it remains safe to
dereference NFS_I(place_holder)->delegation.  If that is not NULL,
then it is either the same delegation that we had before or, just
possibly, a new one.  If it is a new one it will have been added to the
end of the list, so we could end up missing a few delegations.
This is not a critical problem as this is a periodic cleanup and if it
missing some occasionally, it isn't a big problem.
However it would be easy enough to keep track of what the previous
delegation was, and only use the new one if it is the same.  I'll do
that.

True ... and that actually highlights a bug for me.  Earlier where I
have "goto restart" I need to iput(to_put).  Thanks.

If that is true, then the already existing
list_for_each_entry_continue_rcu() also is missing some documentation.

I've removed the word "continue" so it now reads.

 * list_for_each_entry_from_rcu - iterate over a list from current point

Does it really need to be said that you actually have to have a "current
point" that is known to be in the list?  I've added

 * Iterate over the tail of a list starting from a given position,
 * which must have been in the list when the RCU read lock was taken.

in case it does help.

If that was a real risk, surely we would already see it with
list_for_each_entry_continue_rcu().

Thanks a lot,
