When was this introduced? 

3b5cf20cf439 "sunrpc: Use skcipher and ahash/shash"
	- probably not, assuming the above was still just as wrong with
	  crypto_hash_{init,setkey,digest} as it is with
	  crypto_ahash_{init,setkey,digest}

So I'm guessing it was wrong from the start when it was added by
fffdaef2eb4a "gss_krb5: Add support for rc4-hmac encryption" 8 years
ago.  Wonder why it took this long to notice?  Did something else
change?
