Looks good to me but without testing too early for reviewed-by.This is
fairly easy patch to give it because all the details are  in the
underlying patches.

I think I will test the patch set as soon as I'm done with the new API
changes for v19 i.e. make an updated version of my smoke test program
with the use of this vDSO and the new enclave ioctl API. If that works
I'll give this patch tested-by at that point.
