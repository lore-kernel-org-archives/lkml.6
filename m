I need the git commit id of the patch that is in Linus's tree in order
to apply it to the stable tress.  And the text and comments and change
needs to match.  To have a different subject would be really confusing.

You can put a note in the changelog body that says

[note this fixes issue x and y - myname]

which is what some people do.

Care to fix this up and resend?
