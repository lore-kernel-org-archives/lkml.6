Or lives in the crazy modern age, where we have rapidly autodegrading
flash storage and hard disks whose heads pop off with no warning. :D

Yes!!!

I mean... you /could/ allow devices more expansive reporting of their
redundancy capabilities so that xfs could look at its read-retry-time
budget and try mirrors in decreasing order of likelihood of a good
response:

struct blkdev_redundancy_level {
	unsigned		latency;		/* ms */
	unsigned		chance_of_success;	/* 0 to 100 */
} redundancy_levels[blk_queue_get_mirrors()] = {
	{ 10,	    90 }, /* tries another mirror */
	{ 300,      85 }, /* erasure decoding */
	{ 7000,	    30 }, /* long slow disk scraping via SCT ERC */
	{ 1000000,   5 }, /* boils the oceans looking for data */
};

So at least the indices wouldn't be *completely* magic.  But now we have
the question of how do you populate this table?  And how many callers
are going to do something smarter than the dumb loop that it's worth the
extra code?

(Anyone?  Now would be a great time to pipe up.)

Yeah.

<nod> Admittedly, the auto retry and rewrite are dependent solely on the
lack of EIO and the verifiers giving their blessing, and for the most
part online fsck doesn't go digging through buffers that don't pass the
verifiers, so it'll likely never see any of this anyway.
