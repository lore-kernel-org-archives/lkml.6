Very good, I see that Sean agreed with this down thread.  I was
concerned that our discussion was lacking precision and we were
talking past one another.

Let me see if I can impart some framework for additional clarity as
discussions proceed forward.

I believe it would be helpful if we could agree to refer to a body of
code, possibly in library form, that loads, initializes and executes
an enclave as an 'SGX runtime'.  In this framework, the term 'library'
refers to code that an application links to for domain specific
functionality, ie. libpkcs11, libkrb5, libsasl.  These 'libraries' may
implement enclaves, using 'SGX runtimes' of their choice, to improve
their security guarantees.

In this model it is the 'SGX runtime' that is responsible for
registering SGX exception handlers under their management.

In order for mainline Linux SGX support to be relevant, it must admit
mutually distrusting 'SGX runtimes' in the same process context.  The
SGX exception handler architecture must also support the notion of
'nested enclave' invocation where an enclave may execute an OCALL and
then go on to execute an enclave, possibly based on a different 'SGX
runtime', before returning into its previous enclave.

Hopefully the above will help assist further discussions.

Have a good evening.
