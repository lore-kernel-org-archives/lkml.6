You were Cc'ed on that old discussion:

Well, yes, but post/pre are not subject to spreading and I really don't
want to go there.

I don't see how that would break blk-mq. The unmanaged set is not used by
the blk-mq stuff, that's some driver internal voodoo. So blk-mq still gets
a perfectly spread and managed interrupt set for the queues.

Doh. Stupid me.
