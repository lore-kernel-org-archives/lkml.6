Especially with the tree-log.c changes being fairly big, I took a look, and
I have to say that I appreciate (a) the warning in the pull request and (b)
the extensive log messages explaining the problems these patches fix.

I obviously still prefer to see only small and simple one-liners just
before I'm making ready to release rc6, but in the absence of oneliners I
do appreciate good explanations.

Thanks,
