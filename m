"Allows mempools to be embedded in other structs, getting rid of a
pointer indirection from allocation fastpaths."

So this is about using contiguous memory or avoiding partial allocation
failure?  Or both?

Or more to it?  Just trying to fully appreciate the theory behind the
perceived associated benefit.

I do think the increased risk of these embedded bio_set and mempool_t
themselves crossing cachelines, or struct members that follow them doing
so, really detracts from these types of changes.

Thanks,
Mike
