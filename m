I'm not sure what you mean here. The VF and PF drivers are the same
driver. The only difference is that the PF has the extra SR-IOV
configuration space.

What this code is meant to enable is a form of SR-IOV where the VFs
are essentially pre-allocated resources. So for example in our case
the MMIO space is identical for a PF versus any of the VFs. It doesn't
have any special controls in place to allow the PF to manipulate any
of the resources belonging to the VFs.

In the Virtio IO case right now are there any devices that support
SR-IOV? For now this is just an add-on bit to a function that is
already emulating the Virtio in hardware.

This part has me kind of scratching my head. In our setup the "PF" is
really nothing more than a "VF" with the SR-IOV configuration space
attached to it. There are already examples of similar designs for NVMe
and the Amazon ENA devices. Giving the "PF" any functionality in MMIO
space that controls the SR-IOV kind of defeats the whole point of
allowing this function in the first place. Basically the PF isn't
really controlling things, it is the kernel that is doing it.

Yes and no. The original patch set had issues as you could have a PF
assigned to user space and the VFs managed by the host. When I changed
things so that the function had to be in a kernel driver that issue
went away.

I have no clue what you are talking about here. This is the more
careful approach. Are you sure you are reviewing the v7 of the
patches?

My understanding is that no paravirtual interfaces currently expose
SR-IOV. What we are looking at is hardware will want to emulate
Virtio, specifically virtio_net in the future and as a part of that
the PF ends up emulating it as well. What we would need to watch for
going forward is that any device that enables SR-IOV support would
need to also provide a 4 tuple ID so that if something goes wrong with
it we could disable SR-IOV on the device via a PCI quirk later.

The problem is we are talking about hardware/FPGA, not software.
Adding a feature bit means going back and updating RTL. The software
side of things is easy, re-validating things after a hardware/FPGA
change not so much.

If this is a hard requirement I may just drop the virtio patch, push
what I have, and leave it to Mark/Dan to deal with the necessary RTL
and code changes needed to support Virtio as I don't expect the
turnaround to be as easy as just a patch.

Thanks.
