None that I know of.

The individuals I was referring to are CISO's and security risk
managers of multi-billion dollar corporations and/or 3-letter
entities.  It has been my own personal observation that they don't
have time to post to the Linux Kernel Mailing List.

The time they do spend on this technology seems to involve sitting in
meetings and making decisions on whether or not to authorize capital
expenditure budgets for Intel processors and chipsets, based on
whether or not an SGX security stack can definably implement the
security controls that are being imposed on their organizations by the
government and/or their liability carriers.

Such issues may be out of mainstream kernel concerns but hopefully not
conceptually elusive with respect to their implications.
