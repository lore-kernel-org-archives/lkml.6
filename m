s/peer to peer/peer-to-peer/ to match text below and in spec.

s/Peer-to-Peer/peer-to-peer/ to match spec and typical usage.

Is there anything about this memory that makes it specifically
intended for peer-to-peer transactions?  I assume the device can't
really tell whether a transaction is from a CPU or a peer.

"A kernel interface is provided" could mean "the kernel provides an
interface", independent of anything this patch does, but I think you
mean *this patch specifically* adds the interface.

Maybe something like:

  Add interfaces for other subsystems to find and allocate ...:

    int pci_p2pdma_add_client();
    struct pci_dev *pci_p2pmem_find();
    void *pci_alloc_p2pmem();

  This may reduce bandwidth of the transfer but significantly reduce
  ...

BTW, maybe there could be some kind of guide for device driver writers
in Documentation/PCI/?

I think it would be clearer and sufficient to simply say that we have
no way to know whether peer-to-peer routing between PCIe Root Ports is
supported (PCIe r4.0, sec 1.3.1).

The fact that you use the PCIe term "switch" suggests that a PCIe
Switch is required, but isn't it sufficient for the peers to be below
the same "PCI bridge", which would include PCIe Root Ports, PCIe
Switch Downstream Ports, and conventional PCI bridges?

The comments at get_upstream_bridge_port() suggest that this isn't
enough, and the peers actually do have to be below the same PCIe
Switch, but I don't know why.

Until we have a way to figure out which of them support P2P,
performance is a don't-care.

I think the SPDX tag is meant to remove the need for including the
license text, so you should be able to remove this.  Oh, and one
trivial and annoying nit, I think for the SPDX tag, we're supposed to
use "//" in .c files and "/* */" in .h files.

Free pgmap here?  And in the other error case below?  Or maybe this
happens via the devm_* magic?  If so, when would that actually happen?
Would pgmap be effectively leaked until the pdev is destroyed?

s/pci_upstream_bridge/pci_upstream_bridge()/

This whole thing is confusing to me.  Why do you want to reject peers
directly connected to the same root port?  Why do you require the same
Switch Upstream Port?  You don't exclude conventional PCI, but it
looks like you would require peers to share *two* upstream PCI-to-PCI
bridges?  I would think a single shared upstream bridge (conventional,
PCIe Switch Downstream Port, or PCIe Root Port) would be sufficient?

Apologies if you've answered this before; maybe just include a little
explanation here so I don't ask again :)

Maybe call this "peer" or something instead of "p2pdma", since p2pdma
is also used for struct pci_p2pdma things?

Since "pci_p2pdma_add_client()" includes "pci_" in its name, it seems
sort of weird that callers supply a non-PCI device and then we look up
a PCI device here.  I assume you have some reason for this; if you
added a writeup in Documentation/PCI, that would be a good place to
elaborate on that, maybe with a one-line clue here.

Is this a hot path?  I'm not sure it's worth cluttering

Why the double cast?  Wouldn't "(void *)" be sufficient?

In v4.6-rc1, gen_pool_free() takes "unsigned long addr".  I know this
is based on -rc3; is this something that changed between -rc1 and
-rc3?
