Changes since V1:

Apply Matias' feedback:
  - Rebase on top of Matias' latest patches.
  - Use nvme_get_log_ext to submit report chunk and export it.
  - Re-write report chunk based on Matias' suggestions. Here, I
    maintained the lba interface, but it was necessary to redo the
    address formatting to match the chunk log page format. For pblk,
    this means a double address transformation, but it enables the
    standard path to use lbas, plus, this is not in the fast path.
  - Fold address format together with address transformations.
  - Split the generic geometry patch in different patches.
  - Remove refactoring of ligthnvm's core sysfs.

Feedback not applied:
  - Not letting pblk know about 1.2 and 2.0 bad block paths. Since the
    interfaces for get/set bad block and report chunk are so different,
    moving this logic to core adds assumptions on how the targets would
    want to get the data back. A way of doing this is creating a logical
    report chunk on the 1.2 path, but this would mean that values like
    the wear-index are invalid, which requires the target knowledge. I'm
    open to suggestions here.

Also:
  - Do some further renamings
  - Create a generic address format to make it explicit where we share
    1.2 and 2.0 fields to avoid address formatting in the fast path.
  - Add new fields to sysfs to complete spec and show major/minor
    versions (version and subversion to respect current interface).

Implement 2.0 support in pblk. This includes the address formatting and
mapping paths, as well as the sysfs entries for them.
