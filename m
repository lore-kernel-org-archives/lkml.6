Indeed the spec is quite vague at places and leaves too much for the
imagination of the reader.

Sec 6.7.3.4 says:

  Software enables a hot-plug event to generate a wakeup event by
  enabling software notification of the event as described in Section
  6.7.3.1. Note that in order for software to disable interrupt
  generation while keeping wakeup generation enabled, the Hot-Plug
  Interrupt Enable bit must be cleared. For form factors that support
  wake generation, a wakeup event must be generated if all
  three of the following conditions occur:
  * The status register for an enabled event transitions from Clearnot
    set to Set
  * The Port is in device state D1, D2, or D3 Hot , and
  * The PME_En bit in the Port’s Power Management Control/Status register is Set

Which to me means that PMEs are generated based on which events are
enabled regardless whether Hot-Plug Interrupt is enabled or not.

I filed a new bugzilla about this here:

  https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=202593

Let me know if I should re-send with the link corrected.
