If I understand correctly, the shared-variable communication within
sys_membarrier() is included in your proof in the form of ordering
between memory barriers in the mainline sys_membarrier() code and
in the IPI handlers.

The former is a copy-and-paste error on my part, the latter was
intentional because the IPIs among P0, P1, and P2 don't seem to
strengthen the ordering.

Because I hadn't yet thought of the scenario I showed below.

Yes, I do now agree in light of the scenario shown below.

Agreed.  Or I should have said that the above execution is forbidden,
either way.
