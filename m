What given sources say that?  I understand it might be expected, but this is an
common concern with setsockopt method on many protocols, it just so happens that
sctp extends them more than other protocols.

Right, put another way, we support backward compatibility with older userspace
applications, but not newer one.  I.e. if you build an application against the
4.9 SCTP API, it should work with the 4.19 UAPI, but not vice versa, which it
seems is like what you are trying to do here.

There is no real uppper limit to the size of the structure in this case, and
IIRC this isn't the only sockopt structure that can be exentded for SCTP in this
way.

I really don't see a sane way to allow newer userspaces to be compatible with
older kernels here.  If we were to do it I would suggest moving the
responsibility for that feature into lksctp-tools, versioning that library such
that correlary symbols are versioned to translate the application view of the
socket options structs to the size and format that the running kernel
undertands.  Note that I'm not really advocating for that, as it seems like a
fast moving target, but if we were to do it I think that would be the most sane
way to handle it.
