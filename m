I always a bit confused by the usage of "scheduling domain", which
overlaps with the SD concept from the scheduler standpoint.

AFAIU a cpuset sched domain is not granted to be turned into an
actual scheduler SD, am I wrong?

If that's the case, why not better disambiguate these two concept by
calling the cpuset one a "cpus partition" or eventually "cpuset domain"?
