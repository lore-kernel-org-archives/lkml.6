You can submit a patch to add yourself as a Maintainer or Reviewer for
LKMM, Patch #6 in this series is a good example:

	https://marc.info/?l=3Dlinux-kernel&m=3D151916916630299&w=3D2

, and "get_maintainer.pl" will help people find you for memory model
stuffs.=20

I think atomics in Linux kernel(and in LKMM) are purely RCpc, right?
Alan and Andrea?=20

And we are not going to change it, are we?

If atomics in Linux kernel are purely RCpc, then it cerntainly makes
sense for riscv to provide purely RCpc atomics.

I think the problem here is that locks in Linux kernel are more strict
than RCpc but weaker than RCsc, and there is not a well-known concept
for the semantics of locks in Linux kernel AFAIK.
