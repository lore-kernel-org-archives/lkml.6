Mikulas had this feedback:
https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2017-November/msg00159.html

You replied with:
https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2017-November/msg00165.html

Where you said "Yes, you are right something like that would be better."

And you then provided a follow-up patch:
https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2017-November/msg00175.html

That we discussed and I said I'd just fold it into the original, and you
agreed and thanked me for checking with you ;)
https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2017-November/msg00208.html

Anyway, I'm just about to switch to Daddy Daycare mode (need to get my
daughter up from her nap, feed her dinner, etc) so: I'll circle back to
this tomorrow morning.

Thanks,
Mike
