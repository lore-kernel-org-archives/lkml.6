Thanks, Stefan.  Is there a particular paper where I can get a good
idea of what is and is not part of the goals and threat model here?

My impression was that you are measuring things that are executed in an
effort to make sure that anything that can affect resource $x will
be at some point detectable.  But if you allow containers (not in a
user namespace) to evade the ima measurements that seems to undermine
that, so that must not be your goal.  And even if you insist on a
user namespace, if some resource is owned by $uid, then $uid can create
a new namespace, evade the detection, and run malicious code to affect
the resource.

Unless you're counting on the container runtime to set a proper new
ima policy?  But if that's the case then you can't have every CLONE_NEWNS
start a new ima ns.

So I think I need to start from scratch.

thanks,
