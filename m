Yes, I'll do.

Let me ask some hints about the warnings, as I'm not sure how to 'fix' them;
we have:

  a) __HAVE_ARCH_STRNCASECMP
     __HAVE_ARCH_PTE_SPECIAL

  b) Optimized asm/rwsem.h

  c) !ARCH_USES_GETTIMEOFFSET  

For (c), I see two options:

  1. replace that with 'ARCH_USES_GETTIMEOFFSET' (and update the status
     matrix accordingly)

  2. add logics/code to the script to handle simple boolean expressions
     (mmh, this could get nasty really soon... let's say: limiting to a
     leading '!', to start with ;)

For (a), I realize that 'grep-ing' the macros in arch-specific _sources_
does serve the purpose of producing the hard-coded status matrices; but
is this a reasonable approach? (e.g., can produce 'false-positives'?)

What could it be a suitable solution for (b)? are there Kconfig options
which I could in place of that expression? some other suggestion?

Thanks,
  Andrea
