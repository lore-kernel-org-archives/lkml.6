Sorry for that, because I am not a native English speaker and it looks a bit
difficult for me to understand the subtle difference.

The introduced limit is that 'max_vecs' has to be same with 'min_vecs' for
pci_alloc_irq_vectors_affinity() wrt. NVMe's use case since commit
6da4b3ab9a6e9, then NVMe has to deal with irq vectors allocation failure in
the awkward way of retrying.

And the topic has been discussed in the following links:

https://marc.info/?l=linux-pci&m=154655595615575&w=2
https://marc.info/?l=linux-pci&m=154646930922174&w=2

Bjorn and Keith thought this usage/interface is a bit awkward because the passed
'min_vecs' should have avoided driver's retrying.

For NVMe, when irq vectors are run out of from pci_alloc_irq_vectors_affinity(),
the requested number has to be decreased and retry until it succeeds, then the
allocated irq vectors has to be re-distributed among the whole irq sets. Turns
out the re-distribution need driver's knowledge, that is why the callback is
introduced.

Another solution mentioned in previous discussion is to split building & setting up
affinities from allocating irq vectors, but one big problem is that allocating
'irq_desc' needs the affinity mask for figuring out 'node', see alloc_descs().

I mean that NVMe is the only user of irq sets.

Understood.

Thanks,
