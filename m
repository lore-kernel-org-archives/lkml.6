I get that Pid based API is available without any restrictions but do we 
have any existing usecase which requires Pid based API but cannot use 
Pidns-fd based API? Most of the usecases discussed in this thread deals 
with introspection of a process by another process and I believe that 
security requirement for opening (/proc/%d/ns/pid) is required for all 
such usecases. In other words, Why would a process which does not belong 
to same uid of the process observed or have CAP_SYS_PTRACE be allowed to 
translate PID?
