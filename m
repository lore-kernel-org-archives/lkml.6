My general feeling is that userspace should be allowed to do apparently stup=
id things. For example, as far as the kernel is concerned, Wine and DOSEMU a=
re just user programs that do stupid things. Linux generally tries to provid=
e a reasonably complete view of architectural behavior. This is in contrast t=
o, say, Windows, where IIUC doing an unapproved WRFSBASE May cause very odd b=
ehavior indeed. So magic fixups that do non-architectural things are not so g=
reat.

The flip side, of course, is that the architecture is arguably inherently er=
ratic here, and it=E2=80=99s apparently impossible to have an SGX library wi=
th sane semantics without some kernel assistance.

So if we can make my straw man API work, perhaps with vDSO or rseq-like help=
, then the official SDK can use it, but less well behaved programs can still=
 mostly work.  (Modulo Linux=E2=80=99s non-support for EINITTOKEN, of course=
.)

Thinking about it some more, the major sticking point may be finding the RIP=
 and stack frame of EENTER in the AEP code or in its fixup. The vDSO can=E2=80=
=99t use TLS without serious hackery.  We could massively abuse WRFSBASE, bu=
t that=E2=80=99s really ugly.

(How does the Windows case work?  If there=E2=80=99s an exception after the u=
ntrusted stack allocation and before EEXIT and SEH tries to handle it, how d=
oes the unwinder figure out where to start?)
