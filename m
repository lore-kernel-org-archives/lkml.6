Which means, I presume, that there must be some code that somehow
somewhere in the kernel sets-up those mappings and it has to be related
to this patch, in which case I wonder why we enable the PAXC steering at
all given that this (hack) can be done through the IOMMU (and I assume
that on all PAXC platforms that do need MSIs there is an IOMMU IP
upstream the root bridge, otherwise I have no idea what will happen to
those MSI writes).
