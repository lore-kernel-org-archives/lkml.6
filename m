Good idea. I have updated the patchset accordingly.

OK, I'll wait for a few more opinions on these two related issues, and update
the code accordingly then.

My current plan is to push the 109 patch bomb to remove in-kernel calls to syscalls
directly to Linus once v4.16 is released.

For this series of seven patches, I am content with them going upstream through
the x86 tree (once that contains a backmerge of Linus' tree or the syscalls
tree, obviously). IMO, these seven patches should be kept together, and not routed
upstream through different channels.

Thanks,
