Then perhaps we should be talking about "partially generic" code; i.e., 
code that applies to many but not all architectures.

This ignores the attitude of the kernel developers who want locking to 
have the stronger RCtso semantics.  From their point of view, the patch 
enhances the LKMM's applicability.

Because the code might not work!  On RISC-V, for example, the
implementation of ordinary release/acquire is currently not as strong
as atomic release/acquire.

Yes, it's true that implementing locks with atomic_cmpxchg_acquire 
should be correct on all existing architectures.  And Paul has invited 
a patch to modify the LKMM accordingly.  If you feel that such a change 
would be a useful enhancement to the LKMM's applicability, please write 
it.
