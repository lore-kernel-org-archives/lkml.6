It seems that most of the components in the PMICs are just standard
components packed into the PMIC with a control interface provided
over I2C or SPI.

So using compatible for things like ADC, RTC and so on makes sense
if eventually figure out which ones are shared across various
drivers.

Sounds like audio is a bit more fuzzy like Mark describes above.
And by not using a compatible for audio we can have things working
while not establishing and ABI for something that might change
in the future.

Tony
