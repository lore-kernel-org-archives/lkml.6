Yes, this need to be documented.

The root cgroup is special that it owns all the resources in the system.
We generally don't want restriction be put on the root cgroup. A child
cgroup has to be created to have constraints put on it. In fact, most of
the controller files don't show up in the v2 cgroup root at all.

An isolated cgroup has to be put under root, e.g.

      Root
     /    \
isolated  balanced

The purpose of an isolated cpuset is to have a dedicated set of CPUs to
be used by a certain application that makes its own scheduling decision
by placing tasks explicitly on specific CPUs. It just doesn't make sense
to have a CPU in an isolated cpuset to participated in load balancing in
another cpuset. If one want load balancing in a child cpuset, the parent
cpuset should have load balancing turned on as well.

As I look into the code, it seems like root domain is probably somewhat
associated with cpu_exclusive only. Whether sched_load_balance is set
doesn't really matter.  I will need to look further on the conditions
where a new root domain is created.

BTW, there is always a default root domain for the root. So you don't
really need to do anything special for the root cpuset to make one.

It just doesn't make sense to have a CPU in both an isolated CPU set
