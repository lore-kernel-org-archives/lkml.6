Yes. If nothing else you may not even need a feature bit depending on
how things go. One of the reasons why Mark called out the
subvendor/subdevice was because that might be able to be used to
identify the specific hardware that is providing the SR-IOV feature so
in the future if it is added to virtio itself then you could exclude
devices like this by just limiting things based on subvendor/subdevice
IDs.

That piece I don't have visibility into at this time. Perhaps Dan
might have more visibility into future plans on what this might need.

Thanks.
