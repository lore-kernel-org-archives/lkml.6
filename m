The patch in the above link no longer uses "lo->ioctl_in_progress".
You looked at previous version rather than current version.

The patch in the above link uses single global mutex "loop_mutex".

While NULL pointer dereference would be rare, deadlocks might not be rare
enough to postpone the patch. Deadlocks can cause pile of false-positive
hung task reports and can prevent syzbot from finding other bugs. That's
why I say "it is time to think".
