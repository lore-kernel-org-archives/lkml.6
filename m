What you propose is a simple tradeoff between the required on-flash storage
space and the amount of read operations needed to verify the index node integrity.

To get some numbers here: In case of SHA256 and a fanout of 8, we'd store an
additional 224 bytes per index node and safe 7 index node reads per tree level.

I hope it is clear that having a single hash does _not_ mean we have to read
the whole tree! :)

Considering that UBIFS is mostly used in embedded where storage space is rather
precious, we opted for storing a single hash. But sure, storing a hash per
branch/child  is a possibility and we have to discuss if that is acceptable
in most use cases.

As for adding new leaf nodes: If we add a leaf node, we'll always have to recompute
the hash of every index node on the path to the root node. Even with a hash per
branch/child. In case of TNC split/merge operations likely even more.
But I don't get why you think that would mean we have to recompute the hash
on all siblings of that nodes? Or do you simply mean that we have to re-read all
those siblings to compute the hash on the parent?

Thanks,
David
