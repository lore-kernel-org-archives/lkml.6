Hi guys -

This change breaks on older releases like SLES 11 where both <ndbm.h>
and <gdbm.h> define datum, so we get build failures.  The failure is
new, but not because it used to pass and now doesn't.  It's apparently
never built on SLES releases since we ship /usr/include/ndbm.h and then
we notrun the test that uses.  Now that we're looking for gdbm.h and
find it, we attempt to build src/dbtest and fail.

This fix isn't the right solution.  The problem is that we have a couple
layers of old cruft that needs to be cleaned out.

1) As Luis notes, nothing sets HAVE_GDBM_H.  The thing is that there is
no version of gdbm.h that exports the NDBM interface.  Further, looking
at the git history, nothing has ever set HAVE_GDBM_H.  It was dead code
when it was committed initially as best I can tell.
2) openSUSE Tumbleweed doesn't need <gdbm.h> at all.  It needs <ndbm.h>
and this fix works because Luis added it to the HAVE_GDBM_H stanza.
3) AC_PACKAGE_WANT_NDBM used to check for <ndbm.h> but it was a check
for IRIX and the caller was removed ages ago.  It wouldn't matter if it
were called anyway since libndbm is an IRIX library.  Linux, IIRC, has
never shipped a libndbm.

I'll post a few patches following this to clean it up and get it working
on SLES11.
