It depeneds on how hardware implements it. : )
I agree that if it follows the same way of current PR sub feature, then we
could reuse the dfl-fme-pr.c for sure.

Actually I don't know how hardware will implement this in the future, but I
just listed my ideas here. Per my understanding, driver (reuse dfl-fme-pr.c)
needs some more information to decide which platform device to create (for
fpga manager).

1) introduce a new PR sub feature. Then it has a different private feature
id in DFH (Device Feature Header). driver could use this id to create a
different platform device.

2) introduce some registers inside the current PR sub feature. Then driver
could read these registers to know which platform device to create for fpga
manager.

I think either 1) or 2) will only require small changes to current driver
code, I don't have any concern on supporting different PR hardware. :)

I understand your concern on case 2), everybody who wants to reuse dfl-fme-pr.c
needs to implement ID register which is not defined by DFL, so I guess we
should suggest 1).

I see. If we have to create fpga mgr using DT some cases, it makes sense
that we just link the existing one instead.
