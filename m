By proposing the removal of bidi support from the block layer, it isn't
just the SCSI subsystem that will be impacted. Those NVMe documents
that you referred me to earlier in the year, in the command tables
in 1.3c and earlier you have noticed the 2 bit direction field and
what 11b means? Even if there aren't any bidi NVMe commands *** yet,
the fact that NVMe's 64 byte command format has provision for 4
(not 2) independent data transfers (data + meta, for each direction).
Surely NVMe will sooner or later take advantage of those ... a
command like READ GATHERED comes to mind.

Hmm, one pointer (that is null in the non-bidi case) should be enough,
that's 64 or 32 bits.

You won't get any sympathy from me :-) The sg driver is trying to
inject _SCSI_ commands into the SCSI mid-level for onward processing
by SCSI LLDs. So WTF does it have to deal with the block layer.


While on the subject of bidi, the order of transfers: is the data-out
(to the target) always before the data-in or is it the target device
that decides (depending on the semantics of the command) who is first?

     there (ditto for SCSI)
