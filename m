Yes, of course.

Ok, but is there anything that can be done to the sha512
implementation to lower that number? E.g. if a significant chunk
of struct sha512_hash_ctx is only used to hold temporary data,
could it be replaced with e.g. a percpu buffer?

Looking at the callers of crypto_ahash_set_reqsize(), it appears
that the only instance that is so bad is specifically
arch/x86/crypto/sha512-mb/sha512_mb.c, which is architecture
specific, and only one of multiple implementations of sha512.

Am I misreading that code, or does that mean that we could get
away with using the 808 byte limit only on x86 when
CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA512_MB is enabled, but using a smaller
limit everywhere where else?

Yes, definitely. You may recall that I spent several months tracking
down all drivers that grew to insane stack usage when CONFIG_KASAN
was enabled, so we could again turn on the existing stack check
in an allmodconfig build in order to find the normal regressions, so
I'm definitely all for improving both the actual usage and the kind
of diagnostic we have available.

I mainly want to ensure that we have tried anything within reason
to reduce the stack usage of the AHASH_REQUEST_ON_STACK()
users before we resort to changing the warning limit. I'm not
convinced that everything has been tried if we have 808 byte
structures.
