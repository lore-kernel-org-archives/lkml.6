As documented here:

  https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/changes.html#current-minimal-requirements

x86 has effectively dropped support for 4.6 because it doesn't support
retpoline and CONFIG_RETPOLINE is default y.

So it might be time to stop supporting 4.6, but I'd rather that happened
by someone sending a patch to change the requirements doc above, and
then kisskb can stop doing the builds with 4.6.

cheers
