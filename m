A PF-stub to do device-assignment(-like) ops preserves the current security model,
and allows one to add pci-quirks at a device-level as well -- when the usual ACS
structs aren't properly added for a device, which happens quite frequently -- which
retains that common workaround as well.
Yet-another-method for VF assignment w/o even a simple PF driver stub
created multiple failure cases/configs when we were hashing the multiple options
a few weeks ago.
It's just simpler to implement a PF stub w/VF enablement ... b/c it's simple...
