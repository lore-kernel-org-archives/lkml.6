Heh. Yeah, I called this out specifically because I wasn't sure if
this was going to be okay. :P

Yup. I'll get started on it. I did have a version of a python script
that generated coccinelle scripts, but I started losing my mind. I'll
double-check if I can find a way to do some internal-to-Coccinelle
python to handle some of the variation directly, etc.

For those interested in the details: the complexity for me is in how
Coccinelle handles expressions (or my understanding of it's handling).
There's nothing in between "expression" and "identifier", so
"thing->field" is an expression not an identifier ("thing" is an
identifier), but "foo * bar" is _also_ an expression, so I have to
slowly peel away the "easy" stuff (sizeof, constants, etc) before
expressions to avoid collapsing factors into the wrong arguments (e.g.
kzalloc(a * b * c, ...) -> kcalloc(a * b, c, ...) is not desirable),
so there end up being a LOT of rules... I was able to compress
allocation families into a a regex, but without that, I'll end up with
the sizeof/const/etc rules times the family times the kalloc and
_array rules.

Sounds good. Thanks!
