This has been useful when bringing up broken hardware which claims to
support MSI but really doesn't, such as in commit 19bf4d4f909d
("thunderbolt: Support 1st gen Light Ridge controller").  In this case
I didn't know why the controller wasn't sending interrupts, on a hunch
I tried "pcie_hp=nomsi" and that worked, and looking in the macOS source
code I was able to verify that they disable MSI for this particular
hardware as well.  So please leave it in to ease developers' lives.

Thanks,

Lukas
