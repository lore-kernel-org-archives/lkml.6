The "32bitapi" mount option would use 32-bit hash for seekdir
and telldir, regardless of what kernel API was used.  That would
just set the FMODE_32BITHASH flag in the file->f_mode for all files.

Using 32-bit directory hash values is not necessarily harmful, but
it returns the possibility to hit the problem with hash collisions
that previously existed before the move to 64-bit hash values.
This becomes more of a problem as directory sizes increase.

Well, the directory cookies need to be relatively stable over
time because they are exported to applications and possibly
remote nodes via NFS, so it can't be changed very much.

Cheers, Andreas
