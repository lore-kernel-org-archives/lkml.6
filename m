As the antenna selection code changes affected your first bisection, do you have 
one of those HP laptops with only one antenna and the incorrect coding in the 
FUSE? If so, please make sure that you still have the same signal strength for 
good and bad cases. I have tried to keep the driver and the btcoex code in sync, 
but there may be some combinations of antenna configuration and FUSE contents 
that cause the code to fail.
