Yeah it's a bit hard to follow now that we have the split exit paths for
user vs kernel. r4 does get used on the return to userspace case, by
ACCOUNT_CPU_USER_EXIT(), but for the return to kernel it's still got
zero in it.

I'm not sure. It's a bit fragile relying on the r4 value being zero, it
would be easy to accidentally reuse r4. Though it actually wouldn't
matter as long as r4 never has "regshere" in it.

In fact we could store any random value there, it just needs to not be
the exception marker. eg. we could just stick the SRR0 value in there,
that should never alias with "regshere".

But I think maybe we're over thinking it, the cost of the li is pretty
minimal compared to everything else going on here, and this is only on
the return to kernel case, which is arguably not a super hot path.

cheers
