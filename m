Hi Ted,

I don't see that "some kind of machine learning or expert system
evaluation" is feasible. At least not in short/mid-term. There are
innocently-looking bugs that actually turn out to be very bad, and
there are badly looking at first glance bugs that actually not that
bad for some complex reasons. Full security assessment is a complex
task and I think stays "human expert area" for now. One can get some
coarse estimation by searching for "use-after-free" and
"out-of-bounds" on the dashboard.

Also note that even the most innocent bugs can block ability to
discover deeper and worse bugs during any runtime testing. So
ultimately all need to be fixed if we want correct, stable and secure
kernel. To significant degree it's like compiler warnings: you either
fix them all, or turn them off, there is no middle ground of having
thousands of unfixed warnings and still getting benefit from them.

This looks more realistic. +Tetsuo proposed something similar:
https://github.com/google/syzkaller/issues/608

I think to make it useful we need to settle on some small set of
well-defined tags for bugs that we can show on the dashboard.
Arbitrary detailed free-form comments can be left on the mailing list
threads that are always referenced from the dashboard.

What tags would you use today for existing bugs? One would be
"security-critical", right?

I don't think that auto mounting or "requires root" is significantly
relevant in this context. If one needs to use a USB stick, or DVD or
just any filesystem that they did not create themselves, there is
pretty much no choice than to mount it, issuing sudo if necessary. If
you did not create it yourself with a trusted program, there is no way
you can be sure in the contents of the thing and there is no way you
can verify every byte of it before mounting. That's exactly the work
for software. Responsibility shifting like "you said sudo so now it's
all on you" is not useful for users. It's like web sites that give you
a hundred page license agreement before you can use it, but now you
clicked Agree so it's all on you, you read and understood every word
of it and if there would be any concern you would not click Agree,
right?
Fixing large legacy code bases is hard. But there is no other way than
persistent testing and fixing one bug at a time. We know that it's
doable because browsers did it over the past 10 years for much larger
set of input formats.

Well, we have KASAN, almost have KMSAN and will have KTSAN in future.
They can detect detect significant portion of bugs that go unnoticed
otherwise. At least this prevents "bad guys" from also using tooling
to cheaply harvest exploits. Systematic use of these tools on browsers
raised exploit costs to $1M+ for a reason.
