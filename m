Aha, sorry about that.

Well.. encrypting the partition seems like good idea anyway.=20

So your goal is to make hibernation compatible with kernel
lockdown? Do your patches provide sufficient security that hibernation
can be enabled with kernel lockdown?

So how big speedup can be attributed by not doing copy_to_user?

Signatures can be done by uswsusp, too, right?

Answer to bugs in userspace is _not_ to move code from userspace to kernel.

Well, his work can also work without your patchset, right?
