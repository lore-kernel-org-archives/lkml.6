Hi, Eric:

Thanks for your comments. Please see my replies inline.

My apologies. I will investigate and make them consistent.

The primary application for the early notification involves a process
manager which is responsible for re-spawning processes or initiating
the control-plane fail-over. There are two models:

One model is to have 1:1 relationship between a process manager and
application process. There can only be one predump-signal (say, SIGUSR1)
from the child to the parent, and will unlikely be dropped or consolidated.

Another model is to have 1:N where there is only one process manager with
multiple application processes. One of the RT signal can be used to help
make it more reliable.

I was not aware of that before.  Let me investigate.

The timing requirement is about 50-100 msecs for BFD.  Not sure if that
qualifies as "real time".  This mechanism has worked well in deployment
over the years.

I actually tested sigaction()/waitpid() as well. If there is a preference,
I can check in the sigaction()/waitpid() version instead.

This is what Oleg said "but I won't insist, this is subjective and cosmetic".

It is no big deal either way. It just seems less work if we do not keep
adding exceptions to the prctl(2) manpage:
 
prctl(2):

       On success, PR_GET_DUMPABLE,   PR_GET_KEEPCAPS,   PR_GET_NO_NEW_PRIVS,   PR_CAPBSET_READ,    PR_GET_TIMING,    PR_GET_SECUREBITS,
       PR_MCE_KILL_GET,  PR_CAP_AMBIENT+PR_CAP_AMBIENT_IS_SET,  and  (if  it returns) PR_GET_SECCOMP return the nonnegative values described
       above.  All other option values return 0 on success.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

I am not sure which part would be problematic.

Agreed, PDEATHSIG seems to have a few issues ...

I will address your concerns on the patch. Regarding the requirement and the
overall solution, if there are specific questions that I have not answered,
please let me know.

Thanks. -- Enke
