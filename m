No, it's 100% reproducable on systems with that specific card model,
not card instance, and maybe different systems/cards as well, I'll let
David & Alexey comment further on that.

Nope.

We are IBM :-) So far, it seems to be that the card is doing something
not quite right, but we don't know what. We might need to engage
Mellanox themselves.

Cheers,
