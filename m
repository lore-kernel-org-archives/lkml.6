I think the simpler answer is that we do not want to allow GUP or any-
thing similar to pin BAR or device memory. Doing so can only hurt us
long term by fragmenting the GPU memory and forbidding us to move thing
around. For transparent use of device memory within a process this is
definitly forbidden to pin.

I do not see any good reasons we would like to pin device memory for
the existing GPU GEM objects. Userspace always had a very low expectation
on what it can do with mmap of those object and i believe it is better
to keep expectation low here and says nothing will work with those
pointer. I just do not see a valid and compelling use case to change
that :)

Even outside GPU driver, device driver like RDMA just want to share their
doorbell to other device and they do not want to see those doorbell page
use in direct I/O or anything similar AFAICT.

Cheers,
Jérôme
