Once the sha256 bits are in place the subsys tree which has them
merged can create an immutable branch for Greg to merge and
then these can be applied on top of that merge.

But yes this means that these probably won't go in for another
cycle or 2, that is fine.

Ah well, I'm in no big hurry to get this merged. OTOH if this is
ready and that discussion is not yet finished it might be better
to merge this as is and then have the security_kernel_read_file / LSM
hook series fix this up as necessary when it is merged.
