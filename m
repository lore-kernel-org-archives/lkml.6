That sounds reasonable, considering we do unmap the iospace when we 
release - so it looks like currently we're leaving some IO range 
reserved which does not have a mapping.

However this change seems non-trivial, considering we're now even 
coupling the PIO range registration into DT parsing.

Thanks, I had started to put the patch together but if you're happy to 
continue then that's fine. Please let me know.
