I could get behind that as well.  Currently the things I maintain do
approximately this many normal accesses with invocations you can do as a
user:

"efibootmgr -v" - six files we always try to read, plus one per Boot####
		  entry.
"fwupdate --info" - one file it always tries to read, one file for each
                    ESRT entry.
"dbxtool -l" - one file it always reads.
"mokutil --sb-state" - reads the same file twice.  I don't maintain
                       this, but I'll send a patch to Gary to make it
		       only read it once.  AFAICS all of the other
		       invocations you can currently do as a user
		       /legitimately/ read two files, though.

Some systems seem to *love* making a pile of Boot#### entries; I think
the most I've seen is something like 16.  So on that machine, one
"efibootmgr -v" invocation is ~22 efivars files read.  I've never seen a
machine that advertised more than 2 ESRT entries, but maybe we'll get
there some day.
