The HS200 mode is enabled by setting NVQUIRK_ENABLE_SDR104 in nvquirks.
This quirk bit shouldn't be currently set on Tegra124.

I spent last week looking into it. One really weird issue I found was
that when the tuning command is sent, the timeout in sdhci_send_tuning()
sometimes expires. This seems to happen only on certain SD cards and
only if the tap values are modified faster than 10 ms apart. 10 ms is a
really long time which makes this really weird.

Downstream has reimplemented a register polling version of
mmc_send_tuning(), supposedly to avoid interrupt overheads, which oddly
enough seems to work.
