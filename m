If these change could be made in the PCI core, then the class code is no
matter what will be workable for MT7622.

As Lorenzo point it out, it's more reasonable for MT7622 to defined as a
PCI-to-PCI class code since the IP is defined as that. I intend to
following Lorenzo's suggest to update the commit message and re-send
this patch set for current solution.

Thanks for the explain. Per my understanding, MT7622 is more like a
complex of Root Port and PCI-to-PCI bridge. It has type 1 header and has
the ability to translate address between its primary and secondary
buses. I guess apply the class type as PCI_CLASS_BRIDGE_PCI is
reasonable way to make its integrated internal bridge workable.

Thanks.
