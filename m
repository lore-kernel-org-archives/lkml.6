FWIW, I brought this up already at KS 2016, see Jon's coverage here:

	https://lwn.net/Articles/705220/

My primary motivation to bring that up back then was to try to reduce the 
number of patches that are taken into -stable while there is no good 
justification for that (by requiring each and every of those having Fixes: 
present as a requirement), but it didn't really lead anywhere.
