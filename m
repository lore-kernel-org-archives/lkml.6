No new zones please. Pinned pages are essentially mlocked pages, except
they are worse because they cannot be even migrated. What we really
needs is a) limit their usage and b) have a way to find out that pins
are not ephemeral and a special action needs to be taken. What is that
special action is yet to be decided but please do not add even more
complexity on top.
