It isn't crazy at all.  In general we expect people to do their fair
share of core work to get their pet feature in.  How much is acceptable
is a difficult question and not black and white.

But if you want to grow a critical core structure you better take a stab
at converting existing users.  Without that the tradeoff of growing
that core structure is simply not given.

Or to put it in words for this exact feature:  unless your new field
is also used by mainstream file systems it is not going to be added.
