Hi Bjorn,

Thanks for the review. I'll correct all the nits for the next version.

No there's nothing special about the memory and it can still be accessed 
by the CPU. This is just the intended purpose. You could use this PCI 
memory as regular DMA buffers or regular memory but I'm not sure why you 
would. It would probably be pretty bad performance-wise.

Makes sense we can look at writing something for the next iteration.

Fair enough.

I do mean Switch as we do need to keep the traffic off the root complex. 
Seeing, as stated above, we don't know if it actually support it. (While 
we can be certain any PCI switch does). So we specifically want to 
exclude PCIe Root ports and I'm not sure about the support of PCI 
bridges but I can't imagine anyone wanting to do P2P around them so I'd 
rather be safe than sorry and exclude them.

Yes, it happens via the devm magic as that's the way the 
devm_memremap_pages() interface was designed. If I remember correctly, 
in my testing, it would be de-allocated when the driver gets unbound.

Oh, nice, I didn't notice that was added.

Hmm, yes, this may just be laziness on my part. Finding the shared 
upstream bridge is a bit more tricky than just showing that they are on 
the same switch. So as coded, a fabric of switches with peers on 
different legs of the fabric are not supported. But yes, maybe they just 
need to be two devices with a single shared upstream bridge that is not 
the root port. Again, we need to reject the root port because we can't 
know if the root complex can support P2P traffic.

Well yes, but this is much more convenient for callers which don't need 
to care if the device they are attempting to add (which in the NVMe 
target case, could be a random block device) is a pci device or not. 
Especially seeing find_parent_pci_dev() is non-trivial.

I'd say it can be pretty hot given that we need to allocate and free 
buffers at multiple GB/s for the NVMe target case. I don't exactly have 
benchmarks or anything to show this though...

Oh, hmm, I can't remember now. I suspect I added it to fix a kbuild test 
robot error. I'll check and see if it can be removed.

Yes, I think it's taken an unsigned long for a while now. Per the above, 
I can't remember exactly why I casted it this way and I'll take a look 
again.
