The bit I missed was the MDCR_EL2 copy is behind kvm_arm_init_debug(), so we already have
an unnecessary EL2 call here, so its nothing new.

Assuming the deactivate_traps_vhe_put() vcpu isn't needed, and with Mark's comments addressed:

If we can avoid repeated calls to EL2 once we've got HCR_EL2+MDCR_EL2, even better!


Thanks,

James
