OK so at least one of the ports is probably permanently disabled then.

GPS is there for sure, it can be accessed with at least mmcli with
ModemManager running assuming modem instance 0:

$ mmcli -m 0 --enable
$ mmcli -m 0 --location-enable-gps-raw
$ sudo chmod a+r /dev/cdc-wdm0

Then configure gpsd to use /dev/cdc-wdm0.

But having a dedicated NMEA port would be nice. Any ideas how the
GPS port might be enabled for ttyUSB, should it start just printing
out data if GPS is enabled?

FYI, selecting the "BP HW Diag & Boot AP" option from bootloader with the
volume buttons routes the whole modem to the OTG USB interface with
the same ports available to PC so that's probably for cert use.
If needed we can do this from Linux too by just by setting one of
the USB PHY pins high with cpcap_usb_gpio_set_mode().

Regards,

Tony
