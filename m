Usually the way gcc handles this, either each CPU is a strict superset
of another
one, so you just need to specify the one with the smallest instruction set,
or you have an option like -mcpu=generic that produces the common subset.

Ok, fair enough. It's something that can always be added later, as long as
we keep this in mind early on.
