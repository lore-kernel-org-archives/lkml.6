I'm not so sure, look at:

  r5c_do_reclaim():

	if (!list_empty(&sh->lru) &&
	    !test_bit(STRIPE_HANDLE, &sh->state) &&
	    atomic_read(&sh->count) == 0) {
	      r5c_flush_stripe(cond, sh)

Which does:

  r5c_flush_stripe():

	atomic_inc(&sh->count);

Which is another inc-from-zero. Also, having sh's with count==0 in a
list is counter to the concept of refcounts and smells like usage-counts
to me. For refcount 0 really means deads and gone.

If this really is supposed to be a refcount, someone more familiar with
the raid5 should do the patch and write a comprehensive changelog on it.
