Hi Alan,

According to the standard C99 Annex C "the controlling expression of
a selection statement (if or switch)" are the sequence points, just
like a volatile access (READ_ONCE or WRITE_ONCE).

"5.1.2.3 Program execution" states:
"At certain specified points in the execution sequence called sequence
points, all side effects of previous evaluations shall be complete
and no side effects of subsequent evaluations shall have taken place."

So in the example we have 3 sequence points: "READ_ONCE", "if" and
"WRITE_ONCE", which it seems can't be reordered.  Am I mistaken
interpreting standard?  Could you please clarify.
