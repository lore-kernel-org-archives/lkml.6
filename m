Sorry I seemed to miss this email. BTW, what is an "action handler"
here? The IRQ action handler?

Does this ever occur in practice? I imagine "blocking back-end waiting
on a wake-up event" would be some sort of i2c or SPI based "slow" clk
that is prepared/unprepared in the NOIRQ phase of suspend/resume? So
that function call into the clk API fails because the i2c or SPI
controller used to toggle the clk on/off state relies on the
controller's IRQ to manage the transaction over the bus but that IRQ is
disabled. I suppose this is possible but I've never heard of it
happening in practice. Do you have such a scenario?

Is this solved in other situations somehow? I don't think clk consumers
have any idea that things are safe or not safe to use in the NOIRQ phase
of suspend, but I also don't see how clks are special here. Any provider
consumer pattern would fall into the same trap, but maybe clks are the
first ones to get here.

It seems like a larger problem with NOIRQ suspend in general and how it
is too coarse of a solution for suspend ordering of devices. It's not
like we need *all* device interrupts to be disabled to do something in
suspend with one particular device. Most likely, we just need the device
and all it's children to be suspended and this device to have it's IRQ
disabled for the NOIRQ suspend callback to work. (Maybe any devices it's
supplying with device links too?)

If that's really the case, then I can see how one device and it's
children are suspended and the irq for it is disabled but the providing
devices (clk, regulator, bus controller, etc.) are still fully active
and not suspended but in fact completely usable and able to service
interrupts. If that all makes sense, then I would answer the question
with a definitive "yes it's all fine" because the clk consumer could be
in the NOIRQ phase of its suspend but the clk provider wouldn't have
even started suspending yet when clk_disable_unprepare() is called.
