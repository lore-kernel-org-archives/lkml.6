True. I was trying to get it out in a rush. I omitted words.

However; table assumes governance about for which entities firmware first
should be enabled. There is no cross reference to _OSC or permission
negotiation like _OST.

You are right. It was a confusion on my side. The right place to look is
ACPI specification. I was involved in this a couple of years ago. Some pieces
were in UEFI spec. Other pieces were in ACPI. I guess they got unified
now.

I was speculating. I don't have the full background on this. Need to consult
the spec developers.

I agree.
