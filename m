Maybe possible but I am not sure how.

Here's why:

Upon hotplug we want to poke at new bridges if any, but not the old
ones.  The issue is that e.g. with ACPI hotplug the event that Linux
knows how to handle is by design a heavy weight bus rescan.

Specifically 

pci_read_bridge_bases does not
seem to be called on ACPI hotplug path.

Rather,

pci_assign_unassigned_root_bus_resources
pci_assign_unassigned_bridge_resources

would be the two functions in question.


Would above explanation be sufficient? If not, since I understand your
reluctance to pile up hacks, would you be open to doing the suggested
rewrite yourself? Me and xuyandong can help test it.
