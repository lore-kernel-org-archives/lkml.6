I think we should address Russell's concern, he has more insights into
code that predates the PCI host developments.

What I think you can do short term, given that AFAICS MVEBU is not
removable, instead of using pci_host_probe() you move part of its code
into the driver and make sure that you remap IO as last operation before
probe completion (ie after scanning the host bridge) so that you do not
need to unmap it on failure; write a commit log summarising/linking this
thread please and when v4.20 lands we will give this a more thorough
look as Russell requested.

How does that sound ?

Thanks,
Lorenzo
