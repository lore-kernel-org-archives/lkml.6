That would actually be the least of the problems for adding write support.
Adding write support would require at least:

- A way to maintain consistency between the data and hashes, including all
  levels of hashes, since corruption after a crash (especially of potentially
  the entire file!) is unacceptable.  The main options for solving this are data
  journalling, copy-on-write, and log-structured volume.  But it's very hard to
  retrofit existing filesystems with new consistency mechanisms.  Data
  journalling can always be used, but is very slow.

- An on-disk format that allows dynamically growing/shrinking each level of the
  Merkle tree; or, using a different authenticated dictionary structure, such as
  an authenticated skiplist rather than a Merkle tree.  This would drastically
  increase the complexity over a regular Merkle tree.

Compare it to dm-verity vs. dm-integrity.  dm-verity is read-only and very
simple; the kernel just uses a Merkle tree that is generated by userspace.
On the other hand, dm-integrity supports writes but is slow, much more complex,
and doesn't even actually do full-device authentication since it authenticates
each sector independently, i.e. there is no Merkle tree.

I don't think it would make sense for the same device-mapper target to support
these quite different use cases.  And the same general concepts apply at the
filesystem level; for these reasons and others (note that per-block checksums
like btrfs and ZFS wouldn't need a Merkle tree), write support is very
intentionally outside the scope of fs-verity.

So I think any arguments for doing things differently in fs-verity need to be
made in the context of read-only files.

Thanks,

Eric
