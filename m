I'm struggling a bit with this paragraph. Does that mean that you can
use control domains as the target of an instruction changing
configuration on the system? (Or on the VM, if they are listed in the
relevant control block?)

So, NQAP/DQAP need usage domains, while PQAP needs a control domain? Or
is it that all of them need usage domains, but PQAP can target a control
domain as well?

[I don't want to dive deeply into the AP architecture here, just far
enough to really understand the design implications.]

OK, that seems to imply that you modify a control domain by sending a
request to (any) usage domain? I do not doubt that, but the whole
architecture is really confusing :)

How does the control domain mask interact with that? Can you send a
command to an APQN valid for the guest to modify any control domain
specified in the mask? Does the SIE complain if you specify a control
domain that the host does not have access to (I'd guess so)?

So, the adapters or the domains can overlap , but the cross product
mustn't? If I had

Guest1: adapters 1,2 domains 5,6
Guest2: adapters 3,4 domains 5,6

would that be fine?

Is there any rule about shared control domains?

Not sure what that sentence means. Adding/removing devices by the
hypervisor is not supported? Or some guest actions, respectively
injecting notifications that would trigger some actions on the real
hardware?

Do you want to add (some of) this in the future?

Migration and vfio is an interesting area in general :) Would be great
if vfio-ap could benefit from any generic efforts in that area, but
that probably requires that someone with access to documentation and
hardware keeps an eye on developments.
