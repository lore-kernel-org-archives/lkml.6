V3:
- Added Cc: clk driver maintainers - Fabio Estevam
- Added Cc: i.MX arch maintainers - Fabio Estevam
- Removed bouncing email address for Herbert Xu

V2-resend:
- Patch 0005 lost in the ether - resending

V2:
- Endian detection is ok with TrustZone enabled Horia.
  Endian detection logic tested with TrustZone enabled. The register that
  this relies on though isn't affected by the lock-down in the first page.
  Assuming set of affected registers is actually just the 'deco' registers
  though there is no formal statement of that, that I am aware of.

- Moving of TrustZone work-around into u-boot
  This set actually doesn't need to deal with TrustZone at all now but, for
  the sake of consistency keeping thread title

- Fixes to number of clocks declared - Rui

V1:
This patch-set enables CAAM on the i.MX7s and fixes a number of issues
identified with the CAAM driver and hardware when TrustZone mode is
enabled.

The first block of patches are simple bug-fixes, followed by a second block
of patches which are simple enabling patches for the i.MX7Solo - note we
aren't enabling for the i.MX7Dual since we don't have hardware to test that
out but it should be a 1:1 mapping for others to enable when appropriate.

The final block in this series implements a fix for using the CAAM when
OPTEE/TrustZone is enabled. The various details are logged in these
threads.

In simple terms, when TrustZone is active the first page of the CAAM
becomes inaccessible to Linux as it has a special 'TZ bit' associated with
it that software cannot toggle or even view AFAIK.

The patches here then

1. Detect when TrustZone is active
2. Detect if u-boot (or OPTEE) has already initialized the RNG

and loads the CAAM driver in a different way - skipping over the RNG
initialization that Linux now no-longer has permissions to carry out.

Should #1 be true but #2 not be true, driver loading stops (and Rui's patch
for the NULL pointer dereference fixes a cash on this path). If #2 is true
but #1 is not then it's a NOP as Linux has full permission to rewrite the
deco registers in the first page of CAAM registers.

Finally then if #1 and #2 are true, the fixes here allow the CAAM to come
up and for the RNG to be useable again.
