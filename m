Ok so that's a rather standard setup. The "devfn << 8" of your root
ports should be the exact same thing as their first reg property entry,
I'm not sure why you have a mismatch here.

However, that map only represents the INTA..D lines going to the root
ports, not how these get mapped to children of the root ports.

of_irq_parse_pci() will implement standard swizzling if you don't have
nodes for your devices at all. If you do, however, the code assumes
you have a correct and complete interrupt tree in the device-tree.

That means that you need in each "p2p bridge", including your root
ports, an interrupt-map that will map the children INTA...D of that
bridge to the parent INTA...D of that bridge.

Alternatively, you can make the maps in the root ports point directly
to the parent PIC. If you chose to do that, then the interrupt-map in
your root complex becomes only useful to represent the root ports own
interrutps (hotplug, AER,...) and could be replaced by just having
interrupt-parent & interrupts in those root port nodes.

Cheers,
Ben.
