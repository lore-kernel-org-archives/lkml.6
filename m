It was apparently present since LRU was added to xfs buffer cache via:
commit 430cbeb86fdcbbdabea7d4aa65307de8de425350
[xfs: add a lru to the XFS buffer cache]

But I wouldn't say this patch "fixes" that commit.
What do you think? Should a fixes tag be added in this case?

I haven't spotted any differences visible to user, nor in the kernel log.

Thanks very much for feedback. Since it's my very first upstream
commit-proposal,
I expected that some polish would be needed.

So the final commit message could be:
~~~
Currently the xfs_buftarg_isolate() is causing an xfs_buffer
with zero b_lru_ref, to take another trip around LRU, while
isolating buffers with non-zero b_lru_ref.

Additionally those isolated buffers end up right back on the LRU
once they are released, because ->b_lru_ref remains elevated.

Fix that circuitous route by leaving them on the LRU
as originally intended.
