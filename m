One thing that is going to make this more complex at the XFS layer
is discontiguous buffers. They require multiple IOs (and therefore
bios) and so we are going to need to ensure that all the bios use
the same bi_rw_hint.

This is another reason I suggest that bi_rw_hint has a magic value
for "block layer selects mirror" and separate the initial read from
the retry iterations. That allows us to let he block layer ot pick
whatever leg it wants for the initial read, but if we get a failure
we directly control the mirror we retry from and all bios in the
buffer go to that same mirror.

It seems conceptually simple enough - the biggest questions I have
are:

	- how does propagation through stacked layers work?
	- is it generic/abstract enough to be able to work with
	  RAID5/6 to trigger verification/recovery from the parity
	  information in the stripe?

Cheers,

Dave.
