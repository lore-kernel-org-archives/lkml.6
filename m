It was wrong from the start, but the crypto API only recently started enforcing
that the key has to be set before init() or digest() is called.  Before that the
code was just doing unnecessary work, at least with the software HMAC
implementation.  Though, there are also hardware crypto drivers that implement
HMAC-MD5, and it's not immediately obvious that they handle init() before
setkey() as gracefully as the software implementation.
