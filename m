Simplification can mean different things to different people.

Whilst I completely agree that relying on the ordering provided by "dep ;
rfi" is subtle and error prone, having it forbid the outcome above appeals
to a hardware-based mindset of how memory ordering works. In the kernel
community, I would posit that the majority of developers are writing code
with the underlying hardware in mind and so allowing behaviours in the
memory model which are counter to how a real machine operates is likely to
make things more confusing, rather than simplifying them!

IIRC, herd has a feature where you can "flag" the result of a litmus test
to highlight certain internal constraint violations (e.g. warning that a
data race is present in a concurrent C11 program). How about we preserve
the existing semantics, but flag any use of "dep; rfi" to indicate that
the ordering guarantees being relied upon are subtle and error-prone, and
therefore should only be considered for fast-path code?
