I strongly suggest we take a step back, slow down a bit and look at
the original problem.

In driver_pcicore.c there is MIPS specific code. It's protected using
#ifdef CONFIG_SSB_PCICORE_HOSTMODE
(...)
#endif

If anyone has ever seen
ERROR: "pcibios_enable_device" [drivers/ssb/ssb.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "register_pci_controller" [drivers/ssb/ssb.ko] undefined!
make[1]: *** [scripts/Makefile.modpost:92: __modpost] Error 1
it means he managed to get CONFIG_SSB_PCICORE_HOSTMODE set on non-MIPS system.

We should rather answer how did that happen and fix it.

SSB_PCICORE_HOSTMODE depends on SSB_DRIVER_MIPS
SSB_DRIVER_MIPS depends on MIPS

How is that possible to set SSB_PCICORE_HOSTMODE with non-MIPS config?
Is there some mistake in Kconfig I can't see?
