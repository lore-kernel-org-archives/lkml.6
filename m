I read other drivers to handle INTX like pcie-mediatek.c, pcie-altera.c,
and so forth, and understood the common way to rewrite it with chained IRQ.

Using irq_set_chained_handler_and_data() instead of devm_request_irq()
and adding chained_irq_{enter, exit}() to the handler can allow INTX
to handle chained IRQ.

Now I can rewrite INTX part with the above way in v3, though,
I'm not sure whether there is a way to generalize INTX of all dwc drivers,
because of the followings:

- the handler needs to read SoC-dependent register to check which an IRQ line
  of {0,1,2,3},
- domain_ops functions are different for each driver
  (using handle_simple_irq or handle_level_irq, etc.)
- the way to get child interrupt-controller node might be different.

Anyway I think we need to leave these topics until clarifying keystone's
linear irq topic.
