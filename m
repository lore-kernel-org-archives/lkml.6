Hi Rafael, Stephen & Bjorn,

Glad to see you all in this thread that talks about:
  * adding S2RAM support to a PCIe controller driver
  * by taking into account that the PCI clock must be
    {enabled before,disabled after} the PCI IP itself
  * and that it requires some tweaking in the clock driver to
    promote the suspend/resume() callbacks to the NOIRQ phase
    (reference there [1]).

Stephen, Rafael answered here to your remark (in thread [1]) about the
NOIRQ promotion (see below).

Bjorn, there is a question for you below about the need for a PCI
controller driver to suspend/resume in the NOIRQ phase.

Rafael, thanks for the explanation of what the PM core sequences really
are, I would need you to confirm my approach that promotes the clock
suspend/resume() callbacks to the NOIRQ phase, or otherwise give me
pointers to an alternate solution (also below).

I suppose (and I would like Bjorn to validate my thoughts) that this
is a limitation imposed by the PCI core, as described in this
commit:

commit ab14d45ea58eae67c739e4ba01871cae7b6c4586
Author: Thomas Petazzoni <thomas.petazzoni@free-electrons.com>
Date:   Tue Mar 17 15:55:45 2015 +0100

    PCI: mvebu: Add suspend/resume support

    Add suspend/resume support for the mvebu PCIe host driver.  Without this
    commit, the system will panic at resume time when PCIe devices are
    connected.

    Note that we have to use the ->suspend_noirq() and ->resume_noirq() hooks,
    because at resume time, the PCI fixups are done at ->resume_noirq() time,
    so the PCIe controller has to be ready at this point.

Thanks for clarifying, now it is clear and it also answers Stephen
remark in the related thread [1]:

        [PATCH 2/4] clk: mvebu: armada-37xx-periph: change
        suspend/resume time

Stephen, said:

        "This seems sad that the PM core can't "priority boost" any
        suspend/resume callbacks of a device that doesn't have noirq callbacks
        when a device that depends on it from the device link perspective does
        have noirq callbacks."

Ok, then do you agree that the only solution in this case is what I
propose in thread [1], ie. promoting the clock suspend/resume callbacks
to the NOIRQ phase in order to ensure that they will run first (once
device links will be merged too) ?
