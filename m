That's because on the destination, the number of regs is less than on
source, right?

My previous reasoning was:

At the moment, in QEMU, IIUC, we check the KVM_CAP_ARM_PSCI_0_2
capability and if it is advertised, we initialize the vpcu with
KVM_ARM_VCPU_PSCI_0_2. This holds for a 0.2 or 1.0 kernel.

Assuming the source is 1.0 capable and the destination has a < 4.16
kernel so 0.2 only. On migration the fw reg get() returns
KVM_ARM_PSCI_1_0. On Set, wants_02 is set and
vcpu->kvm->arch.psci_version gets set to KVM_ARM_PSCI_1_0.

My question rather was how do you get to know?

The above define is used when initializing the vcpu, right? This now
means we are likely to have a >=0.2 PSCI version and not strictly
speaking a 0.2 one?
