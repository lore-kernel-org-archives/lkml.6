Thanks for the explanation, that make sense. I believe the issue happens
when dealing with restricted pointer types more than regular types. Also,
this is not new and has probably been going on for the last 13 years. For
instance, 81179bb6a54c2c626b4cbcc084ca974bb2d7f2a3 explicitly removed the
__force attribute. I'll send a validation patch for sparse and update this
patch.
