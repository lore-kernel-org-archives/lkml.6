So in this version the requirement is that the importer also have a mmu
notifier registered and that's what all GPU driver do already. Any
driver that map some range of vma to a device should register itself as
a mmu notifier listener to do something when vma goes away. I posted a
patchset a while ago to allow listener to differentiate when the vma is
going away from other type of invalidation [1]

With that in place you can easily handle the pin case. Driver really
need to do something when the vma goes away with GUP or not. As the
device is then writing/reading to/from something that does not match
anything in the process address space.

So user that want pin would register notifier, call p2p_map with pin
flag and ignore all notifier callback except the unmap one when the
unmap one happens they have the vma and they should call p2p_unmap
from their invalidate callback and update their device to either some
dummy memory or program it in a way that the userspace application
will notice.

This can all be handled by some helper so that driver do not have to
write more than 5 lines of code and function to update their device
mapping to something of their choosing.

This does not work for GPU really i do not want to have to rewrite GPU
driver for this. Struct page is a burden and it does not bring anything
to the table. I rather provide an all in one stop for driver to use
this without having to worry between regular vma and special vma.

Note that in this patchset i reuse chunk of Logan works and intention is
to also allow PCI struct page to work too. But they should not be the
only mechanisms.

So what is this O_DIRECT thing that keep coming again and again here :)
What is the use case ? Note that bio will always have valid struct page
of regular memory as using PCIE BAR for filesystem is crazy (you do not
have atomic or cache coherence and many CPU instruction have _undefined_
effect so what ever the userspace would do might do nothing.

Now if you want to use BAR address as destination or source of directIO
then let just update the directIO code to handle this. There is no need
to go hack every single place in the kernel that might deal with struct
page or sgl. Just update the place that need to understand this. We can
even update directIO to work on weird platform. The change to directIO
will be small, couple hundred line of code at best.

Cheers,
Jérôme
