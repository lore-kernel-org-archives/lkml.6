Yes, this is to the nfc core. But my uart phy driver binds to the pn533
driver and this does then register to nfc core. So this needs some more
changes to pn533 driver to be able to be informed of dev_up/down.
I'll look into this tomorrow.

Is there a way in serdev to close a port, but still occupy it ?
I'd like to do the basic chip initialisation in _probe and then close
the port for power-consuption reasons. I'd like to have the port still
occupied, so that it's not available to other possible users in the
meantime. I'd then do a serdev open again in dev_up and really use it
from there.
dev_down is then for serdev close and also still occupy it.
closing and releasing would then be done in _remove.

Regards,
Lars
