I agree, because of the implicit memory barrier from spin_unlock_bh(),
READ_ONCE shouldn't really be needed in this case.

I think that it's a good thing to be critical of all "just-in-case" things,
however, it's not always that obvious if you actually need READ_ONCE or not.

E.g. you might need to use it even when you are holding a spin_lock.

Some people recommend to use it for all concurrent non-read-only shared memory
accesses: https://github.com/google/ktsan/wiki/READ_ONCE-and-WRITE_ONCE

Is there a better guideline somewhere..?


Kind regards,
Niklas
