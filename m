OK I'll respin my series to take this approach.

I don't quite follow this logic. Should that not have been:

if (!(pmu->capabilities & PERF_PMU_CAP_EXCLUDE) &&
     event_has_exclude_flags(event)) {

Meaning that if an event has any exclude flags but the pmu doesn't
have the capability to handle them then error.

If you're happy with my proposed logic, then would it also make
sense to move this before the call to the pmu->event_init ?

Thanks,
