In theory, you still may generate and manage the IPTT in the LLDD by
simply ignoring rq->tag, meantime enabling SCSI_MQ with 16 hw queues.

However, not sure how much this way may improve performance, and it may
degrade IO perf. If 16 hw queues are exposed to blk-mq, 16*.can_queue
requests may be queued to the driver, and allocation & free on the single
IPTT pool will become a bottleneck.

Per my experiment on host tagset, it might be a good tradeoff to allocate
one hw queue for each node to avoid the remote access on dispatch
data/requests structure for this case, but your IPTT pool is still
shared all CPUs, maybe you can try the smart sbitmap.

It isn't a new problem, we discussed it a lot on megaraid_sas which has
same situation with yours, you may find it in block list.

Kashyap Desai did lots of test on this case.

Please switch to none io sched in your test, and it is observed that IO
perf becomes good on megaraid_sas.
