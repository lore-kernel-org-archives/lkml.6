I mean that since libsas does disocovery/revalidation for all expander 
PHYS for a single event, than all discovery/revalidation should be 
synchronised with that same event. I don't mean that for a given 
expander PHY which originated a broadcast event, the 
revalidation/discovery for that PHY should be synchronised with that 
same event. Like you said, I don't think it's possible.

On another point, one of the reasons to synchronise event processing was 
so events are not lost and are processed in order. In principle, by 
chaining these bcast events we lose that, since other PHY events may be 
queued before we queue the new artificial bcast events.

Something like that, where all the discovery/revalidation and related 
device + port processing is done before we complete the revalidation 
event processing. A single revalidation event may defer do device+port 
processing multiple times.
