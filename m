For the case where clone/reflink or copy_file_range is supported - is
there any reason to
not sent the request to copy the whole file? Presumably long
timeout/errors might be a concern, but
that could happen with ranges too.  In any case, if sent the whole
file copy request,
the server file system can figure out the  holes and copy more efficiently.

In the case where it is copying local to remote or remote to local -
figuring out whether it is
sparse and optimizing makes a lot of sense - but I didn't think cp did
that (at least the
sections of code I was looking at).
