Herd does not need to understand s390 assembly in order to handle the 
things defined in linux.def, such as "smp_mb()".  linux.def doesn't 
contain any x86 assembly language stuff either (or PPC or ARM).

No, don't drop it; it was not the source of your spurious ordering.  
The extra ordering came from your "(po \ (W * R))" term, which 
unintentionally matches fences as well as memory accesses.

I don't think so...

Exactly.

You could just keep the "uniproc" check.  These two approaches accept 
the same set of litmus tests.

Logically, I think of these as two distinct categories of ordering.  
po_ghb and tso-mca have to do with the order in which stores reach the 
cache, whereas "uniproc" (AKA sequential consistency per variable) has 
to do with enforcement of the cache coherence requirements.  Clearly 
they are related, but they aren't the same thing.
