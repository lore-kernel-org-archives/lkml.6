Well, GFP_DMA32 is clearly under-documented. But I _believe_ the
intention was to really return a physical memory within 32b address
range.

This would be something for the higher level allocator I think. The page
allocator is largely unaware of IOMMU or any remapping and that is good
IMHO.

The name is misnomer following GFP_DMA which is arguably a better fit.
GFP_MEM32 would be a better name.

Btw. I believe the GFP_VMALLOC32 shows that our GFP_DM32 needs some
love. The user shouldn't really care about lowmem zones layout.
GFP_DMA32 should simply use the appropriate zone regardless the arch
specific details.
