I applied this whole series to pci/lpc for v4.17.

I made the following whitespace and other trivial corrections.
Hopefully I didn't break anything.

     HISI LPC: Support the LPC host on Hip06/Hip07 with DT bindings
     
-    The low-pin-count(LPC) interface of Hip06/Hip07 accesses the peripherals in
-    I/O port addresses. This patch implements the LPC host controller driver
-    which perform the I/O operations on the underlying hardware.
-    We don't want to touch those existing peripherals' driver, such as ipmi-bt.
-    So this driver applies the indirect-IO introduced in the previous patch
-    after registering an indirect-IO node to the indirect-IO devices list which
-    will be searched in the I/O accessors to retrieve the host-local I/O port.
-    
-    The driver config is set as a bool instead of a trisate. The reason
-    here is that, by the very nature of the driver providing a logical
-    PIO range, it does not make sense to have this driver as a loadable
-    module. Another more specific reason is that the Huawei D03 board
-    which includes hip06 SoC requires the LPC bus for UART console, so
-    should be built in.

-    LIB: Introduce a generic PIO mapping method
+    lib: Add generic PIO mapping method
     
-    In commit 41f8bba7f555 ("of/pci: Add pci_register_io_range() and
-    pci_pio_to_address()"), a new I/O space management was supported. With
-    that driver, the I/O ranges configured for PCI/PCIe hosts on some
-    architectures can be mapped to logical PIO, converted easily between
-    CPU address and the corresponding logicial PIO. Based on this, PCI
-    I/O devices can be accessed in a memory read/write way through the
-    unified in/out accessors.
-    
-    But on some archs/platforms, there are bus hosts which access I/O
-    peripherals with host-local I/O port addresses rather than memory
-    addresses after memory-mapped.
-    
-    To support those devices, a more generic I/O mapping method is introduced
-    here. Through this patch, both the CPU addresses and the host-local port
-    can be mapped into the logical PIO space with different logical/fake PIOs.
-    After this, all the I/O accesses to either PCI MMIO devices or host-local
-    I/O peripherals can be unified into the existing I/O accessors defined in
-    asm-generic/io.h and be redirected to the right device-specific hooks
-    based on the input logical PIO.
+    41f8bba7f555 ("of/pci: Add pci_register_io_range() and
+    pci_pio_to_address()") added support for PCI I/O space mapped into CPU
+    physical memory space.  With that support, the I/O ranges configured for
+    PCI/PCIe hosts on some architectures can be mapped to logical PIO and
+    converted easily between CPU address and the corresponding logical PIO.
+    Based on this, PCI I/O port space can be accessed via in/out accessors that
+    use memory read/write.
+    
+    But on some platforms, there are bus hosts that access I/O port space with
