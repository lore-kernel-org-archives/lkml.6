I disagree with this, at least as a unilateral statement.  I would assert that
an old program, within the constraints of the issue being discussed here, will
run perfectly well, when built and run against a new kernel.

At issue is the size of the structure sctp_event_subscribe, and the fact that in
several instances over the last few years, its been extended to be larger and
encompass more events to subscribe to.

Nominally an application will use this structure (roughly) as follows:

...
struct sctp_event_subscribe events;
size_t evsize = sizeof(events);

memset(&events, 0, sizeof(events));

events.sctp_send_failure_event = 1; /*example event subscription*/

if (sctp_setsocktpt(sctp_fd, SOL_SCTP, SCTP_EVENTS, &events, &evsize) < 0) {
	/* do error recovery */
}

....


Assume this code will be built and run against kernel versions A and B, in
which:
A) has a struct sctp_event_subscribe with a size of 9 bytes
B) has a struct sctp_event_subscribe with a size of 10 bytes (due to the added
field sctp_sender_dry_event)

That gives us 4 cases to handle

1) Application build against kernel A and run on kernel A.  This works fine, the
sizes of the struct in question will always match

2) Application is built against kernel A and run on kernel B.  In this case,
everything will work because the application passes a buffer of size 9, and the
kernel accepts it, because it allows for buffers to be shorter than the current
struct sctp_event_subscribe size. The kernel simply operates on the options
available in the buffer.  The application is none the wiser, because it has no
knoweldge of the new option, nor should it because it was built against kernel
A, that never offered that option

3) Application is built against kernel B and run on kernel B.  This works fine
for the same reason as (1).

4) Application is built against kernel B and run on kernel A.  This will break
because the application is passing a buffer that is larger than what the kernel
expects, and rightly so.   The application is passing in a buffer that is
incompatible with what the running kernel expects.

We could look into ways in which to detect the cases in which this might be
'ok', but I don't see why we should bother, because at some point its still an
error to pass in an incompatible buffer.  In my mind this is no different than
trying to run a program that allocates hugepages on a kernel that doesn't
support hugepages (just to make up an example).  Applications built against
newer kernel can't expect all the features/semantics/etc to be identical to
older kernels.

It shouldn't.  Assuming you have a program built against headers from kernel B
(above), if you set a field in the structure that only exists in kernel B, and
try to run it on kernel A, you will get an EINVAL return, which is correct
behavior because you are attempting to deliver information to the kernel that
kernel A (the running kernel) doesn't know about.  Thats correct behavior.

I won't disagree about the niceness of versioning, but that ship has sailed.

To be clear,  this is situation (1) above, and yeah, running on the kernel you
built your application against should always work from a compatibility
standpoint.

Yes, but this is alawys the case for structures that change.  If you have an
application built against kernel (B), and uses structure fields that only exist
in that version of the kernel (and not earlier) will fail to compile when built
against kernel (A) headers, and thats expected.  This happens with any kernel
api that exists in a newer kernel but not an older kernel.

Any time you make a system call to the kernel, you have to be prepared to handle
the resulting error condition, thats not unexpected.  To assume that a system
call will always work is bad programming practice.
