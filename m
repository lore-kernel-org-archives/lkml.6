At least 1/2 the cases presented to me by existing customers want it in a tunable kernel,
and tunable btwn two points, if the hw allows it to be 'contained' in that manner, which
a (layer of) switch(ing) provides.
To me, that means a kernel cmdline parameter to _enable_, and another sysfs (configfs? ... i'm not a configfs afficionato to say which is best),
method to make two points p2p dma capable.

Worse case, the whole system is one large IOMMU group (current mindset of this static or run-time config option),
or best case (over time, more hw), a secure set of the primary system with p2p-enabled sections, that are deemed 'safe' or 'self-inflicting-unsecure',
the latter the case of today's VM with an assigned device -- can scribble all over the VM, but no other VM and not the host/HV.
