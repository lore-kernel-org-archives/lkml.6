Isn't Landlock mostly intended for userspace that wants to impose a
custom Mandatory Access Control policy on itself, restricting the
whole process?

As far as I can tell, a major usecase for AT_BENEATH are privileged
processes that do not want to restrict all filesystem operations they
perform, but want to sometimes impose limits on filesystem traversal
for the duration of a single system call. For example, a process might
want to first open a file from an untrusted filesystem area with
AT_BENEATH, and afterwards open a configuration file without
AT_BENEATH.

How would you do this in Landlock? Use a BPF map to store per-thread
filesystem restrictions, and then do bpf() calls before and after
every restricted filesystem access to set and unset the policy for the
current syscall?
