In pcie_do_write_cmd(), please just move the

	ctrl->slot_ctrl = slot_ctrl;

above the call to pcie_capability_write_word().

AFAICS an explicit memory barrier isn't needed here because of the call to
pcie_capability_write_word(), which "will [ordinarily] be guaranteed to be
fully ordered and uncombined" (Documentation/memory-barriers.txt, section
"KERNEL I/O BARRIER EFFECTS").

The memory barrier in pciehp_isr() is also bogus because the following
wake_up() implies a memory barrier if a task was woken.  (And if none
was woken, who cares.)

That is an approach I'd strongly object to:  While pciehp itself only
signals very few interrupts (making an additional mmio read appear to
be negligible), it may share its interrupt with other devices.  On my
MacBookPro9,1, a hotplug port of the Thunderbolt controller shares
its interrupt line with the Wifi card and SD card reader, and those
may signal a huge number of interrupts.  On such a machine an additional
mmio read per interrupt becomes a problem.

Thanks,

Lukas
