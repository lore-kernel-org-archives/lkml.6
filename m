Yes, this is basically how we handle bus resets through vfio-pci, if
there are multiple devices affected by a bus reset, slots or functions,
the caller needs to prove ownership of all of them before we do a bus
reset.  That's great for video cards where we have the GPU and audio
functions typically assigned together anyway, but I don't know that
it's a great solution for IB where you're more likely to want to assign
separate functions to separate users and nobody can get the device to
run at full speed unless all the functions are assigned to one user.
Thanks,

Alex
