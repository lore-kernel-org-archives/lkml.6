No, I'm just busy, it's the merge window next week :)

I thought the comment was pretty clear, if the stores are observed out
of order we might print the uninitialised tail.

And the barrier on the read side would need to be in printk somewhere,
which is obviously unpleasant.

It is not my intention to support concurrent updates of the string. The
idea is you setup the string early in boot.

The concern with a concurrent reader is simply that the string is dumped
in the panic path, and you never really know when you're going to panic.
Even if you only write to the string before doing SMP bringup you might
still have another CPU go rogue and panic before then.

But I probably should have just not added the barrier, it's over
paranoid and will almost certainly never matter in practice.

cheers
