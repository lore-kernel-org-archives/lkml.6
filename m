memory-barriers.txt has been updated as follows:

"When using writel(), a prior wmb() is not needed to guarantee that the
cache coherent memory writes have completed before writing to the MMIO
region."

Remove old IA-64 comments in the code along with unneeded wmb() in front
of writel().

There are places in the code where wmb() has been used as a double barrier
for CPU and IO in place of smp_wmb() and wmb() as an optimization. For
such places, keep the wmb() but replace the following writel() with
writel_relaxed() to have a sequence as

wmb()
writel_relaxed()
mmio_wb()
