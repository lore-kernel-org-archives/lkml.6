Sorry, I'm not understanding here. What's the performance impact and
what do you mean by original version?

I guess I was assuming gcc would be smart enough not to spill stuff
on the stack. I also intentionally removed the register keyword
since it wasn't clear gcc does much with it on a modern system? I
could be completely off base here though so please correct me if
I'm wrong. It probably is worth documenting what we are assuming about
the compiler here.

For reference, I originally added this for the efistub because
it would not compile. I did compile this against my Fedora tree
which has KVM enabled.
