Okay, that's a fair point that I'd missed reading your first mail.  It's
worth a shot.  That said, EFI_FIRMWARE_VOLUME_PROTOCOL is part of the
PI spec, not the UEFI spec.  It's not required in order to implement UEFI,
and some implementations don't use it.  Even when the implementation
does include PI, there's no guarantee PI protocols are exposed after the
"End of DXE" event (though edk2 will expose this, I think).

Yeah, it's probably worth implementing your way and using it when we
can.

This is not actually the case.  There is more than one implementation of
UEFI, and they do not all implement PEI/DXE/etc from the PI spec.  For
two examples, there are still vendors that ship EDK-I implementations on
some platforms, and current u-boot can be built to export a UEFI API.
(It's a subset, but so is every other implementation.)

This is not correct.  Not all UEFI implementations implement *any* of
PI.  Also, AFAIK, nothing we use in Linux so far directly depends on
anything in PI.

No, he's saying that it's really easy to implement a driver with the
device firmware in a char [] in the code, so cheap ODMs who supply a
UEFI driver with their hardware part are very, very likely to have done
that instead of providing two things to go into the FV - a UEFI driver
*and* a separate image for the device firmware.  This also cuts out a
point of failure between the OEM and the ODM.

It already works...
