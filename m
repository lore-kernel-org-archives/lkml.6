Hi, Jerome, 

I reconsider your logic. I think the problem can be solved. Let us separate the
SVA/SVM feature into two: fault-from-device and device-va-awareness. A device
with iommu can support only device-va-awareness or both.

VFIO works on top of iommu, so it will support at least device-va-awareness. For
the COW problem, it can be taken as a mmu synchronization issue. If the mmu page
table is changed, it should be synchronize to iommu (via iommu_notifier). In the
case that the device support fault-from-device, it will work fine. In the case
that it supports only device-va-awareness, we can prefault (handle_mm_fault)
also via iommu_notifier and reset to iommu page table.

So this can be considered as a bug of VFIO, cannot it?

In the case, we cannot do anything if the device do not support
fault-from-device. But we can reject write map with file-backed mapping.

It seems both issues can be solved under VFIO framework:) (But of cause, I don't
mean it has to)
