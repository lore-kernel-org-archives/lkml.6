Note that as I understand it, the entire point of documenting this sort
of thing is to help solidify the interface between a DT aware boot
program (e.g., bootloader) and a device tree which is provided
separately, to avoid memorizing node/path hierarchy. It doesn't need to
(and doesn't, as I read it) enforce an OS's device naming policy.

That part is not a DT spec problem :)

This seems to be a much different sort of problem. People always love
having predictable IDs given by the OS (myself included), but that's
just plain hard to do and impossible in some cases. I don't think that's
what this document is about though.

IOW, this document seems pretty consistent with the above: it doesn't
require the usage of aliases (and it seems silly to have a driver
*require* an alias) -- it just documents how one should name such an
alias if you expect multiple independent software components to
understand it.

That's fair enough. Just because the solution isn't an all-purpose tool
doesn't mean it shouldn't be documented. The general concept is already
in ePAPR, but it's just not very specific about property names.
