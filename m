Hi, Eric:

It turns out that the definition of CLD_PREDUMP could well be considered as
another instance of "over specification", and is completely unnecessary.  When
an application chooses a signal for pre-coredump notification, it is much simpler
and robust for the signal to be dedicated for that purpose (in the parent) and
not be mixed with other semantics. The "signo + pid" should be sufficient for
the parent process in both 1:1 and 1:N models.

So I will remove the CLD_PREDUMP and related definitions, and the code can then
be simplified as the following:

+static void do_notify_parent_predump(void)
+{
+	struct task_struct *parent;
+	int sig;
+
+	read_lock(&tasklist_lock);
+	parent = current->parent;
+	sig = parent->signal->predump_signal;
+	if (sig != 0)
+		do_send_sig_info(sig, SEND_SIG_NOINFO, parent, PIDTYPE_TGID);
+	read_unlock(&tasklist_lock);
+}

I will follow up with your other comments.

Thanks. -- Enke
