Hi Kishon,

I started reviewing the series, I noticed that some patches are
clean-ups that I would like to queue to cut the delta so that you
can rebase on top of them, do you have time to post the clean-up
patches (no functional changes) stand-alone so that I can queue
them up please ?

I think you should drop the RFC tag from this series.

Thanks,
Lorenzo
