Umm...  I'll try and see how well does that work.

To quote a mail from last July:

||             common  bfin,frv,m68k,mips       xtensa  sparc
||WRNORM bit      8       2                       2       2
||WRBAND bit      9       8                       8       8

||
||Now, POLLREMOVE doesn't have EPOLL... equivalent, but others

||(and also never triggered) and EPOLLRDHUP not matching anything.
||

MSG and REMOVE are never triggered, so it's all down to {WR{NORM,BAND},RDHUP}.

Logics for mangle should be uniform - lower 8 bits left as is,
EPOLLWRBAND -> POLLWRBAND, EPOLLWRNORM -> POLLWRNORM, EPOLLRDHUP -> POLLRDHUP.

For demangle it's
if POLLOUT != POLLWRNORM
	pass as is
else
	lower 8 bits left as-is,
	if POLLOUT
		add EPOLLWRNORM
	POLLWRBAND -> EPOLLWRBAND
	POLLRDHUP -> EPOLLRDHUP

Frankly, it's a bloody mess - we either shouldn't have bothered with separate
POLLRDNORM and POLLWRNORM at all (they should be equivalent to POLLIN and POLLOUT
resp.) or kept them separate on all architectures.  What's more, we don't have
only one instance of POLLRDNORM that would not be a part of POLLIN | POLLRDNORM | ...
(modulo reordering).  Its definition, that is.  We do have a few instances of
->poll() that raise POLLIN without POLLRDNORM, but AFAICS they have only one
thing in common - "forgot to add POLLRDNORM or hadn't heard of it".  The set is
pretty much random...

It started in 2.1.23pre1; looks like the original braindamage came from SunOS compat
(in 1.3.93) and got propagated into generic when poll(2) was implemented.  Probably
we should've kept alpha and i386 POLL... definitions same as sparc ones...  Anyway,
it's at least 20 years too late for that.
