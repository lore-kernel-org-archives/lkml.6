I should probably evict the SELinux bits into their own patch since the point
of this patch is the LSM hooks, not specifically SELinux's implementation
thereof.

Using the fsopen()/fsmount() syscalls, these hooks will be made use of, say
for NFS (which I haven't included in this list).  Even sys_mount() will make
use of them a bit, so just booting the system does that.

Note that for SELinux these hooks don't change very much except how the
parameters are handled.  It doesn't actually change the checks that are made -
at least, not yet.  There are some additional syscalls under consideration
(such as the ability to pick a live mounted filesystem into a context) that
might require additional permits.
