NAK.

Nothing in regular device drivers is supposed to ever fiddle with struct
irq_desc. The existing code is already a violation of that rule and needs
to be fixed, but not in that way.

The logic here is completely screwed. affinity_hint is set by the driver,
so the driver already knows what it is. If the driver does not set it, then
the thing is NULL.
