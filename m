It is basically the predecessor to PAPR "Power Architecture Platform Reference".
Which the LoPAPR document is available through power.org. Not sure if there is
any desire to adopt PAPR in place of RPA. It is the platform reference doc that
outlines how we do DLPAR and PCI Hotplug.

pseries is still used as a machine type for PAPR compliant qemu/kvm instances.

Again, just my 2 cents. I'm pretty open to whatever makes the most sense.
