Ok, I think this is the "random gcc versions act differently" issue.

Sometimes __builtin_constant_p() to a ternary operation acts as a
constant expression, and sometimes it doesn't.

Oh well.

Yeah, sparse doesn't get picky about "constant value" vs "constant
expression" normally. But some things do use the strict form, and
array index expressions is one of those cases.

No, it's correct, it's just that the semantics of exactly when
something is considered constant are a bit fluid.

I suspect using the __is_constexpr() trick would make it rather more
technically correct, but would actually generate much worse code.

Because it would make us do that dynamic "__ilog2_uXX()" function call
even when you have a compile-time constant value, if it wasn't
actually a constant expression (ie a constant argument passed to an
inline function, for example).

So I guess your patch is fine, but I also wonder if we should just
default sparse to allow the good old non-strict "constant values are
ok" for indexes.

And turn on strict mode only with -pedantic or something.
