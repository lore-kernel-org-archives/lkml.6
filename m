Yes, I also like it for simplicity.  It also avoids the requirement
of translating the number (in bytes?) given by the user to
"number of GIMPLE instructions" as needed by the inliner.

Heh, but I failed to make an example with attribute synatx working.
IIRC attributes do not work on stmts.  What could work is to use
a #pragma though.
