Yes, this works, although it is clearly just a stopgap.  And obviously
it can't be applied in situations where one of the legs of the "if"  
statement contains a non-trivial branch.

In the long run, I don't think this problem is solvable.  At least, not 
for all cases.  It requires too much guesswork about what optimizations 
a compiler might do.
