Yes, this is a known issue with the Designware PCIe core, not just on
i.MX6. As soon as any MSI interrupt is enabled, the core doesn't
forward legacy IRQs anymore.

So if any card in your system needs legacy interrupts (and ath9k is
very likely to need this, as MSI support is pretty new and
experimental), you need to boot with "nomsi" set on the kernel command
line.
