For the fsnotify use-case, this assumption makes sense as fsnotify has
an abstraction of fsnotify_group which is created by the
person/process interested in the events and thus can be used to hold
the reference to the person/process's memcg. Another use-case I have
in mind is the filesystem mount. Basically attaching a mount with a
memcg and thus all user pages and kmem allocations (inodes, dentries)
for that mount will be charged to the attached memcg. In this use-case
the super_block is the perfect structure to hold the reference to the
memcg.

If in future we find a use-case where this assumption does not make
sense we can evolve the API and since this is kernel internal API, it
should not be hard to evolve.

I am not sure, I didn't find other similar patterns (like PF_MEMALLOC)
having debugging facility. Maybe we can add such debugging facility
when we find more users other than kmalloc & kmem_cache_alloc. Vmalloc
may be one but I could not think of a use-case for vmalloc for remote
charging, so, no need to add more code at this time.

I understand the concern but the charging path, IMO, is much complex
than just one or couple of additional branches. I can run a simple
microbenchmark to see if there is anything noticeable here.

Thanks for your time.
