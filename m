And more to the point, here is a three-process variant showing a cycle
that is permitted:


         P0      P1      P2
         Wa=2    Wb=2    Wc=2
         mb0s
                 [mb01]  [mb02]
         mb0e
         Rb=0    Rc=0    Ra=0

As can be seen by reordering it as follows:

         P0      P1      P2
                         Ra=0
         Wa=2
         mb0s
                 [mb01]
                 Rc=0
                         Wc=2
                         [mb02]
         mb0e
         Rb=0
                 Wb=2

Make sense?

							Thanx, Paul
