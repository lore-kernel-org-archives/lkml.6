Yes, I meant the hash area.

We do have to be very careful here, but the same restriction already exists with
fscrypt which both f2fs and ext4 already support too.  With fscrypt, each page
is decrypted with the key from page->mapping->host->i_crypt_info and the
initialization vector from page->index.  With fs-verity, each page is verified
using the Merkle tree state from page->mapping->host->i_verify_info and the
block location from page->index.  So, they are very similar.

On f2fs, any pages submitted via META_MAPPING just skip both fscrypt and
fs-verity since the "meta_inode" doesn't have either feature enabled.  That's
done intentionally, so that garbage collection can move the blocks on-disk.
Regular reads aren't done via META_MAPPING.

I don't know of any plan to use fs-verity on Android's system partition or to
replace dm-verity on the system partition.  The use cases so far have been
verifying files on /data, like APK files.

So I don't think you need to support fs-verity in EROFS.

Re: the compression, I don't see how it would be much of a problem (even if you
did need or want to add fs-verity support).  Assuming that the verification is
done over the uncompressed version of the data, you wouldn't verify the pages
directly from the bio's page list since those would contain compressed data.
But even without fs-verity you'd need to decompress the data into pagecache
pages... so you could just call fsverity_verify_page() on each of those
decompressed pages before unlocking them and setting them Uptodate.  You don't
*have* to call fsverity_verify_bio() to do the verification; it's just a helper
for the case where the list of pages to verify happens to be in a completed bio.
