Yes we can do special wrapper around the general case that allow
caller to differentiate failure. So at creation you call the
special flavor and get proper distinction between error. Afterward
during normal operation any failure is just treated in a same way
no matter what is the reasons (munmap, mremap, mprotect, ...).

You do not have to worry about boundaries HMM will return -EFAULT
if there is no valid vma behind the address you are trying to map
(or if the vma prot does not allow you to access it). So then you
can handle that failure just like you do now and as my ODP HMM
patch preserve.
