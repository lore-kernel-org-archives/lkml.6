I think this is the most important part, and I should have elaborated
on it instead of getting into the driver structure details below.

It is a major goal of ACPI and PCI that an old kernel should work
unchanged on a new platform unless it needs to use new functionality
introduced in the new platform.

amd_nb.c prevents us from achieving that goal.  These patches don't
add new functionality; they merely describe minor topographical
differences in new hardware.  We usually try to do that in a more
generic way, e.g., via an ACPI method, so the new platform can update
the ACPI method and use an old, already-qualified, already-shipped
kernel.

I'm not strenuously objecting to these because this isn't a *huge*
deal, but I suspect it is a source of friction for distros that don't
want to update and requalify their software for every new platform.

amd_nb.c uses pci_get_device(), which is incompatible with hotplug and
subverts the usual driver/device ownership model.  We could pursue
this part of the conversation, but I think it's more fruitful to
approach this from the "new machine, old kernel" angle above.
