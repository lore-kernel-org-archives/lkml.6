So, what's the way ahead for multipath-tools? 

Given that, IIUC, at least one official kernel (4.19) has been released
with ANA support but without the ANA sysfs attributes exported to user
space, multipath-tools can't rely on them being present. I for one have
no issue with copying code from nvme-cli and doing NVMe ioctls from
multipath-tools, as in Lijie's patch. When those sysfs attributes are
added (and work as expected), we will use them, but IMO we'll need to
fall back to ioctls until then, and also afterwards, because we can't
assume to be always running on the latest kernel.

Best,
Martin
