This strikes me as just an "extra layer of signal handlers"; rather
than replacing global state with something that's library-safe, it's
just making new global state that has to have a singleton owner
managing it. If these handlers were thread-local (vs process-global
signal disposition) then you could just register/unregister them on
entry/exit to the library code that needs them, but that has
nontrivial execution time cost.

Moreover, thread-local signal handlers can already be done really
nicely if you don't care about having a global handler (which doesn't
really make sense for synchronous signals). I have fairly canonical
draft code I wrote to demonstrate this a while back which I can share
if there's interest.

One possible advantage of your approach is that it could distinguish
actual synchronous signals from ones sent by kill/sigqueue/etc. This
matters in contexts where the application wants the signal blocked or
ignored. For example if you temporarily set a handler for SIGILL or
SIGSEGV, then unblock it and try to do something that might generate
the signal, you risk consuming an unrelated pending signal sent by
kill/sigqueue/etc. As far as I know there is no way to do this
"transparently". It came up as an issue for why libc init code cannot
do this kind of probing for instruction availability at startup (or
any time).

I'm not familiar with SGX but the vdso approach sounds like a better
abstraction.

I don't think this is useful. If you really need a division that needs
to survive invalid operands, a simple check before the div
(100%-predictable branch in non-erroneous usage) is dirt cheap.

> (c) Ditto for floating point errors.

Signaling floating point exceptions (rather than sticky flags) are
something of an oddity that's never enabled by default, not supported
on all platforms, and largely (IMO) useless. Generating code that can
support them can be moderately costly too.

In general this seems fairly useful.

Agree re: userfaultfd.

Agree, this is a huge rabbit hole of filth. Don't go there.
