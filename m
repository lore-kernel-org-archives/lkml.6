Yeah I think just remove it, it's not a well known term and is unlikely
to help anyone these days.

It stands for "RISC Platform Architecture", which was some kind of
specification for Power machines back in the day, but from what I can
tell it was never used in marketing or manuals much (hence so few hits
on Google).

No I don't think so.

TBH these are pretty unhelpful too. PowerNV is not a marketing name and
so doesn't appear anywhere much in official manuals or brochures and
it's also used on non-IBM branded machines. And pSeries & iSeries were
marketing names but are no longer used.

We should probably update that text, but we can do that later, rather
than blocking this patch.

This is used in non-IBM machines as well.

So perhaps: ?

	tristate "IBM/OpenPower PowerNV (bare metal) PCI Hotplug driver"

I think just drop RPA here.

To be complete:
	  This includes the earlier System p, System i, pSeries and iSeries.

Again just drop RPA.


cheers
