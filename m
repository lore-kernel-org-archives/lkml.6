The sparse warning is clearly spotting a real issue. I tried to at least
have big endian handle correctly the 0-255 case. I am willing to drop
the change (since I agree it's not very satisfying and will mask an issue), 
but may I ask you to explain how it is wrong ? How would you correctly expand 
an u8 to __le16 ? I think in big endian we need to swap the bytes.

I was thinking the same. I don't know whether this buf contains a
standard struct or something hw-specific. I'll try to dig further and
submit a separate patch if I can. Maybe Aditya can give more information
?
