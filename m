Interesting concern. There are micro-architectural quirks on x86 too
that the current code actually already considers. Notably, we use an
AVX-512VL path for Skylake-X but an AVX-512F path for Knights Landing
and Coffee Lake and others, due to thermal throttling when touching the
zmm registers on Skylake-X. So, in the code, we have it automatically
select the right thing based on the micro-architecture.

Is the same thing not possible with ARM? Do you not have access to this
information already, such that the module can just always do the right
thing and not require any user intervention?

If so, that would be ideal. If not (and I'm curious to learn why not
exactly), then indeed we could add some runtime nobs in /sys/module/
{algo}/parameters/{nob}, or the like. This would be super easy to do,
should we ever encounter a situation where we're unable to auto-detect
the correct thing.

Regards,
Jason
