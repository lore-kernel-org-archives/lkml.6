At the very edge of stability, you see write errors under heavy load.
As clock rate increases, the write errors occur more frequently.
At a certain point, you start getting read errors.
Following that you get constant io errors during card probing.
Eventually the emmc will fail to initialize, with errors 87 or 110.

I've been tweaking the pull up/down values to try and improve the 
stability, but without access to anything but the TRM it's a lot of 
trial and error.

No, it did not affect stability.
Although I'd conduct some performance testing to check for degradation.
Of course I'm nowhere near the limits of the controller, so it is 
doubtful I'd see a hit.
