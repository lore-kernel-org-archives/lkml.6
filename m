Subject: [PATCH v3 00/15] dra7: mmc: Update mmc dt node to use sdhci-omap

Previous version of the patch series was sent here
https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/2/6/250

Most of the patches sent for v2 was merged. Remaining unmerged patches
from v2 and a few additional patches are sent here.

This series should be merged only after [1].
[1] -> https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=152465820531802&w=2

This series:
 *) Adds wilink wlan support (Now all MMC instances in DRA7 will use
    sdhci-omap)
 *) Add a new pinctrl group for clk line without pullup required for
    UHS cards to work reliably.
 *) Update README to make sure users update .config file from 4.18
    kernel.
 *) Use sdhci-omap programming model.

In the "Use sdhci-omap programming model" patch, "ti,omap4-hsmmc"
compatible is removed. This is because if both "ti,dra7-sdhci" and
"ti,omap4-hsmmc" is added and if there is probe deferral in sdhci_omap
driver, the device is binding to omap_hsmmc driver.

Once omap_hsmmc and sdhci_omap driver are feature identical,
sdhci_omap driver will be made to support omap_hsmmc binding
(including "ti,omap4-hsmmc" compatible) and omap_hsmmc driver will
be removed. Till then dt nodes with "ti,omap4-hsmmc" compatible
will use omap_hsmmc driver and "ti,dra7-sdhci" compatible will
use sdhci_omap driver.
