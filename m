This makes a ton of sense, and I'm going to ack the patch, but here is
one issue here:

This isn't quite equivalent to what we have right now.

Yes, nr_dirty, nr_unqueued_dirty and nr_congested apply to file pages
only. That part is about waking the flushers and avoiding writing
files in 4k chunks from reclaim context. So those numbers do need to
be compared against scanned *file* pages.

But nr_writeback and nr_immediate is about throttling reclaim when we
hit too many pages under writeout, and that applies to both file and
anonymous/swap pages. We do want to throttle on swapout, too.

So nr_writeback needs to check against all nr_taken, not just file.
