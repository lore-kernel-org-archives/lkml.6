You're right and wrong.  GCC can't even estimate the size of mildly 
complicated inline asms right now, so your claim of it being necessary for 
correctness can't be true in this absolute form.  I know what you try to 
say, but still, consider inline asms like this:

     insn1
  .section bla
     insn2
  .previous

or
   invoke_asm_macro foo,bar

in both cases GCCs size estimate will be wrong however you want to count 
it.  This is actually the motivating example for the kernel guys, the 
games they play within their inline asms make the estimates be wildly 
wrong to a point it interacts with the inliner.

No, see above, even if we were to improve the size estimates (e.g. based 
on some average instruction size) the kernel examples would still be off 
because they switch sections back and forth, use asm macros and computed 
.fill directives and maybe further stuff.  GCC will never be able to 
accurately calculate these sizes (without an built-in assembler which 
hopefully noone proposes).

So, there is a case for extending the inline-asm facility to say 
"size is complicated here, assume this for inline decisions".

The size of the inline asm wouldn't be counted towards the inliner size 
limits (or be counted as "1").

TBH, I like the inline asm (...) suggestion most currently, but what if we 
want to add more attributes to asms?  We could add further special 
keywords to the clobber list:
  asm ("...." : : : "cc,memory,inline");
sure, it might seem strange to "clobber" inline, but if we reinterpret the 
clobber list as arbitrary set of attributes for this asm, it'd be fine.

I think the examples I saw from Boris were all indirect inlines:

  static inline void foo() { asm("large-looking-but-small-asm"); }
  static void bar1() { ... foo() ... }
  static void bar2() { ... foo() ... }
  void goo (void) { bar1(); }  // bar1 should have been inlined

So, while the immediate asm user was marked as always inline that in turn 
caused users of it to become non-inlined.  I'm assuming the kernel guys 
did proper measurements that they _really_ get some non-trivial speed 
benefit by inlining bar1/bar2, but for some reasons (I didn't inquire) 
didn't want to mark them all as inline as well.


Ciao,
Michael.
