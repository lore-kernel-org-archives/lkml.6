Actually the suggestion I had from Don Dutile was that we should be
looking at creating a pci-stub like driver specifically for those type
of devices, but without the ability to arbitrarily assign devices.
Basically we have to white-list it in one device at a time for those
kind of things.

If you have the device ID of the thing you wanted to have work with
pci-stub before I could look at putting together a quick driver and
adding it to this set.

Thanks.
