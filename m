So we have (at least) two ways how to handle:

- warn and fail the mount -- catch typos and the like, continuing with
  default could cause problems later though not that severe as the
  compressionw would be different than expected, but this could be
  considered a usability bug

- only warn and continue with the default -- not mounting a root
  filesystem just because of a typo can be worse than mounting with
  wrong level; as long as there's a warning in the log, the user still
  has a working system and can fix it manually

Both have some pros and cons and initially I was more inclined to pick
the 1st option, but now that I'm thinking about that again, the other
has some merit.

Given that zlib now falls back to default for unrecognized level, we
should probably stick to that for zstd too.
