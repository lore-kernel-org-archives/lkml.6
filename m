Spelling out "Software Guard eXtensions" somewhere around here would
be nice.

As would be notice that due to Spectre / Meltdown / L1TF / ... this
sandboxing functionality does not really work on any CPU that is on
the market today.

Would it be possible to explain what this means? Basically my BIOS
decides what enclaves I can run? Who generates the EINITTOKENs and can
my code get one?=20

What other priviledges does signed SIGSTRUCT give to the enclave?

Aha, so in current kernel implementation kernel decides what enclaves
I can run?

Anyway, all this is "interesting reading" but not really suitable for
system administrator who is not expert in Intel CPUs. Do we need some
kind of explanation for ARM kernel hackers, system administrators and
other interested parties?
