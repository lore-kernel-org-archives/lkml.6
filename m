I don't think I was in that email.

There are two parts to the question. One is raid5's bio completion
assumptions and the other is whether we can avoid bio_get()/put() in
pblk's read path. The first part is pblk independent and I would like to
leave it open as I would like to understand how bio_reset() in this
context is correct. Right now, I cannot see how this is correct
behaviour.

For the pblk specific part, see below.

I don't follow how the relationship with struct request completion is
different with bio_get/put and without.

The flow in terms of bio and struct request management is today:

  generic_make_request()
   pblk_submit_read()
     bio_get()
      ...
     blk_init_request_from_bio()
     blk_execute_rq_nowait() / blk_execute_rq() // denepnding on =
sync/async
      ...
     bio_endio()
     bio_put()
      ...
     blk_mq_free_request()

bios risk to always freed in any case, as bio_put() will the last pblk
reference. The only case in which this will not happen is that somebody
else took a bio_get() on the way down. But we cannot assume anything.

I guess the problem I am having understanding this is how we can risk
the bio disappearing underneath when we are the ones completing the bio.
As I understand it, in this case we are always guaranteed that the
bio is alive due to the allocation reference. Therefore, bio_get()/put()
is not needed. Am I missing anything?

Thanks,
Javier
