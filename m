Ok, that's an argument in favour of option (2).

Which will make them sort-of equivalent... meaning: both the POSIX
sched_setparam() and the !POSIX sched_setattr() will allow to change
params/attributes without changing the policy.

The sched_setscheduler() requires a policy to be explicitely defined,
it's a mandatory parameter and has to be specified.

Unless a RT task could be blocked by a FAIR one and you need
sched_setscheduler() to boost both prio and class (which looks like a
poor RT design to begin with) why would you use sched_setscheduler()
instead of sched_setparam()?

They are both POSIX calls and, AFAIU, sched_setparam() seems to be
designed exactly for those kind on use cases.

Mmm... could be... I'll look better into it. Could be that that mutex
is not really required. We don't need to serialize task specific
clamp changes and anyway the protected code never sleeps and uses
atomic instruction.

> Also; do you expect these clamp values to be changed often?

Not really, the most common use cases are:
 a) a resource manager (e.g. the Android run-time) set clamps for a
    bunch of tasks whenever you switch for example from one app to
    antoher... but that will be done via cgroups (i.e. different path)
 b) a task can relax his constraints to save energy (something
    conceptually similar to use a deferrable timers)

In both cases I expect a limited call frequency.

Yes, I agree that two paths in __sched_setscheduler() could be
confusing. Still we have to consider that here we are adding
"not class specific" attributes.

What if we keep "not class specific" code completely outside of
__sched_setscheduler() and do something like:

---8<---
    int sched_setattr(struct task_struct *p, const struct sched_attr *attr)
    {
            retval = __sched_setattr(p, attr);
            if (retval)
                return retval;
            return __sched_setscheduler(p, attr, true, true);
    }
    EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(sched_setattr);
---8<---

where __sched_setattr() will collect all the tunings which do not
require an enqueue/dequeue, so far only the new uclamp settings, while
the rest remains under __sched_setscheduler().

Thoughts ?
