Hi, Arnd.
I am really sorry to reply so late, since I seldom use this email account
in recent years. I will add my new email account to related bits.

Let me clarify the status of UniCore. It's a real cpu-core product,
integrated into PKUnity SoC, and sold in a large amount of embedded boxes,
such as cloud terminals and set top boxes. Surely, we still use the port
internally and keep doing developments in other projects. So, I really
appreciate having unicore32 port in the tree.

As to gnu toolchain of UniCore, I have already discussed it in my group,
and I'll do my best to propel it forward.

Thanks,
Guan Xuetao
