FWIW, it's not been do_IRQ() who wrote the exception marker, but it's
caller hardware_interrupt_common(), more specifically the
EXCEPTION_PROLOG_COMMON_3 part therof.

I thought about this a little more and can't see anything that would
prevent higher, i.e. non-_switch() frames to also alias with prior
exception frames. That STACK_FRAME_REGS_MARKER is written to a stack
frame's "parameter area" and most functions probably don't initialize
this either. So, AFAICS, higher stack frames could potentially be
affected by the very same problem.

I think the best solution would be to clear the STACK_FRAME_REGS_MARKER
upon exception return. I have a patch ready for that and will post it
after it has passed some basic testing -- hopefully later this day.

That being said, I still think that your patch should also get applied
in some form -- looking at unitialized memory is just not a good thing
to do.

I would perhaps not limit this to the STACK_FRAME_REGS_MARKER, but also
not emit the ip obtained from the first frame into the resulting trace.

I.e., how about moving all the sp/newsp handling to the beginning of the
loop and doing an 'if (firstframe) continue;' right after that?

Thanks,

Nicolai
