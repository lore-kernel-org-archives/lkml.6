Four queue nodes per cpu are allocated to enable up to 4 nesting levels
using the per-cpu nodes. Nested NMIs are possible in some architectures.
Still it is very unlikely that we will ever hit more than 4 nested
levels with contention in the slowpath.

When that rare condition happens, however, it is likely that the system
will hang or crash shortly after that. It is not good and we need to
handle this exception case.

On bare metal system, a new acquire_lock_no_node() function is now
added to deal with this case. The pending bit together with a new
waiting bit are overloaded to serve a special function as noted
below. The special tail value _Q_TAIL_WAITING is used as a special
flag by acquire_lock_no_node() to signal the next cpu to spin on the
waiting bit which is used as separator for the now disjointed queue.
Please see the comments in the code for the details.

On virtual machine, a new and simpler pv_acquire_lock_no_node() function
is used to directly steal the lock as lock stealing is allowed in the
PV locking path.

By doing so, we are able to support arbitrary nesting levels with no
noticeable performance degradation for the common case of <= 4 nesting
levels.
