Ah, yes. This is about buffer alignment, particularly when using DMA.

Normally there should be no constraint on the alignment, if the
mmc/sdio controller driver would implement a fallback mechanism from
DMA to PIO mode, in case the buffer can't be used for DMA.

However, I know about cases where simply PIO doesn't work because of
broken HW and in many cases the mmc drivers don't implement the
fallback to PIO even if they could.

Moreover, it seems reasonable to anyway have a way for mmc driver to
inform upper layers about DMA buffer alignment constraints, as to be
able to use DMA as long as possible.

Thoughts?

Kind regards
Uffe
