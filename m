Well, yes and no.
syz_mount_image() is the only part of a large system that knows about
images. For the rest of the system it's just a syscall like any other
syscall. And the part that sends emails is far away from
syz_mount_image().
syzbot does not know per se that it sends an email to filesystems
list. It just extracted kernel source file name that looked relevant
to this crash and run get_maintainers.pl on it.
Also the image can contain dynamically generated data, which makes it
impossible to have as a file at all.

Thinking of this, what should be reasonably easy to do and may be a
compromise for near future is the following. We could insert code into
syz_mount_image() which dump the image if you build a program with a
special define (e.g. -DSYZ_DUMP_IMAGE). Will this work for you?

As I said, bisection is on our plate:
https://github.com/google/syzkaller/issues/501
Though, we will see how well it works, because it's not trivial (see
the issue for details).

Report footer will be improved to make it more clear:

There is a human contact at syzkaller@googlegroups.com. Report footer
will be improved to make it more clear:

See above. It may not be necessary representable as a static file at all.

What is "> 1 allocation group"?
