Because there is nothing else ? :)

Well in O_DIRECT case there is only one page table, the CPU
page table and it gets updated during fork() so there is an
ordering there and the race window is small.

More over programmer knows that can get in trouble if they
do thing like fork() and don't synchronize their threads
with each other. So while some weird thing can happen with
O_DIRECT, it is unlikely (very small race window) and if
it happens its well within the expected behavior.

For hardware the race window is the same as the process
lifetime so it can be days, months, years ... Once the
hardware has programmed its page table they will never
see any update (again mlx5 ODP is the exception here).

This is where "issues" weird behavior can arise. Because
you use DONTFORK than you never see weird thing happening.
If you were to comment out DONTFORK then RDMA in the parent
might change data in the child (or the other way around ie
RDMA in the child might change data in the parent).

This has a cost and you don't want to do it for O_DIRECT. I am pretty
sure that any such patch to modify fork() code path would be rejected.
At least i would not like it and vote against.

John is trying to fix serious bugs which can result in filesystem
corruption. It has a performance cost and thus i don't see that as
something we should pursue as a default solution. I posted patches
to remove get_user_page() from GPU driver and i intend to remove
as many GUP as i can (for hardware that can do the right thing).

To me it sounds better to reward good hardware rather than punish
everyone :)

Yes for RDMA and VFIO, but i want to avoid any more new users hence
why i push back on any solution that have the same issues.

I agree
