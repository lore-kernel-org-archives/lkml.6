If that's true, your vendor was very unlucky in choosing 0xabcd.  They
also have a pretty serious misunderstanding of how PCI IDs work, which
will cause you major headaches if they continue allocating Device IDs
from the Synopsys space.

In this particular case it's probably not a disaster because the
i.MX6QP and i.MX7D devices are both bridges (Root Ports, I think), and
we don't currently have any drivers that claim those by ID.  The
portdrv claims them by Class Code.

I think that'd be a good idea.  I think portdrv will claim the Root
Port first, before dwc3-haps has a chance, so the driver core won't
even call dwc3_haps_probe().

But if you unset CONFIG_PCIEPORTBUS or boot with "pcie_ports=compat",
I bet dwc3-haps *will* claim it, and things will fail a little less
gracefully.
