(I know nothing about this EQS stuff, but) there is a third path that might be
relevant.

For non-VHE systems guest_enter_irqoff()() is called just before we jump to EL2.
Coming back gives us an exception-return, so we have a context-synchronisation
event there, and I assume we will never patch the hyp-text on these systems.

But with VHE on the upcoming kernel version we still go on to run code at the
same EL. Do we need an ISB on the path back from the guest once we've told RCU
we've 'exited user-space'?
If this code can be patched, do we have a problem here?

Shouldn't this be at the point that RCU knows we've exited user-space? Otherwise
there is a gap where RCU thinks we're in user-space, we're not, and we're about
to tell it. Code-patching occurring in this gap would be missed.

This gap only contains 'enable_daif', and any exception that occurs here is
safe, but its going to give someone a nasty surprise...

Mark points out this ISB needs to be after RCU knows we're not quiescent:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/4/3/378

Can't this go in the rcu exit-quiescence code? Isn't this what your
rcu_dynticks_eqs_exit_sync() hook does?


Thanks,

James
