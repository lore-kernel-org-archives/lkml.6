After an offline discussion with Matias, we have agreed that
bio_get/put() should not be necessary on pblk's read path (Matias,
please correct me if my understanding is not correct). As mentioned
before too, we have been running internally without them for some time
without problems. I'll send a patch for the next window removing them.

This said, I believe that a generic_make_request driver should be able
to do bio_get/put without side consequences. Thus, I still doubt that
raid5's assumption that it can reset the bio on bio_end_io is correct
(and if yes, I would like to understand why). Thoughts?

Javier
