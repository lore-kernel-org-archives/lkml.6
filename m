x86: uses node in common struct pci_sysdata
ia64: uses node in common struct pci_controller
powerpc: uses node in common struct pci_controller
sparc: uses numa_node in common struct pci_pbm_info
arm64: uses dev_to_node(&bus->dev) and node is set via pcibios_add_bus()

MIPS right now has no common struct, which is reachable via bus->sysdata,
if CONFIG_PCI_DRIVERS_LEGACY is not selected (and I want to get away
with that option). So I liked the arm64 way, but I didn't want to implement
pcibios_add_bus just for SGI-IP27 and noticed, that pcibios_add_bus
is called for child and root bus, while add_bus method only for
child buses. So my patch gives add_bus the same power as pcibios_add_bus
already have. Is this good enough as argument ?

there is always a different way of course. If you don't like my patch
I'll find one ;-)
