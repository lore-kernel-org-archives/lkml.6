Hi Bjorn,

Thank you very much for you time and solution.

We see both ASPM and LTR issues with samsung device SM961/PM961.
But the same device works fine with multiple other platforms, means we
have to debug our RC.

So far we see issue with samsung device only. Need to explore more.

We need to disable common clock configuration which is done in the part of ASPM.
If we enable common clock, we see issues with samsung device.

As you suggested I am using patch 2 and 4 which are suitable to our requirement.
Until we resolve the HW issue, we will continue to use these patches.
