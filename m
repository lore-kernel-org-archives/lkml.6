Why start again?
Taking the trap at all suggests the guest knows about pointer-auth, if it uses
it, its probably in some context switch code. It would be good to avoid trapping
that.

Yuck!

Can we only expose the feature to a guest if both address and generic
authentication are supported? (and hide it from the id register otherwise).

This avoids having to know if this cpu supports address/generic when the system
doesn't. We would need to scrub the values to avoid guest-values being left
loaded when something else is running.

(mainline has a system_supports_address_auth(), I guess this will be folded
around a bit during the rebase).

kvm_supports_ptrauth() that checks the two architected algorithm caps?

... so we don't need this? Or if it ever runs its indicative of a bug?

(If you include the the IS_ENABLED() in here too, the compiler can work out
pointer-auth was compiled out and prune all the unused static functions.)

(shame we can't re-use the arch code's macros for these)

I thought the generic authentication bits had a separate ID-register-field/cap?
But you only checked address-auth above. Is it possible the CPU doesn't have
this register?

(but I think we should only support this if both generic&address are supported)

This is deep in the world-switch code, meaning we save/restore 10 sysregs for
every entry/exit. As the kernel isn't using pointer-auth, wouldn't it be better
to defer the save/restore to the preempt notifier using kvm_arch_vcpu_load()?

I've seen the discussion that the kernel may start using this 'soon':
lore.kernel.org/r/20181112223212.5o4ipc5kt5ziuupt@localhost

(does anyone know when soon is?)

... but it doesn't today, and save/restoring these in C becomes impossible when
that happens, which the arch code is doing too, so we aren't inventing a new
problem.


probable-tangent: {
If the kernel starts using ptrauth, it will need to switch these registers in
the entry asm, and in __cpu_switch_to()... there will be new asm macro's to do this.

Can we make it so that the same series that does that, can easily do KVM too?

If we use the preempt-notifier stuff the GET/SET_ONE_REG code knows that today
the ptrauth values are always loaded on the cpu, it doesn't need to look in the
sys_reg_descs[] array.
This means the preempt notifier could save/restore them to a struct ptrauth_keys
in struct kvm_vcpu_arch. This lets us use the arch codes __ptrauth_key_install()
and ptrauth_keys_switch() helpers today, instead of duplicating them because the
layout is slightly different.

Once these become asm macros, the same structure is already in use, so we can
(cough) probably feed it a different base pointer for guest-entry/ret_to_user.
guest-exit would almost be the same as kernel_enter, its only the
save-guest-values that would be specific to kvm.

(oh, and the GET/SET_ONE_REG code would need to know to look elsewhere for the
guest values, but it looks like your patch 5 is already doing some of this).

Don't we still want to remove the imp-def bits? and the APA/GPA bits if we
decide there is incomplete support.
