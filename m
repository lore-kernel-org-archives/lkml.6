The Problem with this is Single user mode, where you can assign users to locking ranges.
There would have to be a lot of dynamic changes of sysfs as users get added/removed,
or added to LRs etc. It seems like we're trying mold something that already
works fine into something that doesnt really work as we dig into the details.

I generally like the idea of being able to run your abritrary opal commands, but:

that's probably not going to work for the final reason you outlined.
Even though it's root only access(to sysfs) we're breaking the authentication
lower down by essentially allowing any opal command to be ran if you've somehow
become root.

The other issue with this is the session time out in opal. When we dispatch the commands
in-kernel we're hammering them out 1-by-1. If the user needs to do an activatelsp,
setuplr, etc. They do that with a new session.

If someone starts the session and it times out it may be hard to figure out how to not
get an SP_BUSY back from the controller. I've in the past just had to wipe my damn
fw to get out of SP_BUSYs, but that could be due to the early implementations I was
dealing with.

Sorry to ocme back a week later, but if you do have anything it would be at least
interesting to see. I would still prefer the ioctl route, but will review and test
any implementation people deem acceptable.
