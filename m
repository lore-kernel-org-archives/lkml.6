We are dealing with this now. More appropriate to do it this time than 
before having reworked set.

It is completely appropriate to use RapidIO on any architecture that has 
PCI/PCIe using existing PCIe-to-SRIO host bridges. Works well with 
Marvell and NVIDIA boards.

Confusion here is caused by the fact that there are ARM and non-ARM 
devices that offer on-chip RapidIO host controllers as well as PCIe. 
E.g. TI Keystone/KeystoneII, FSL 85xx/86xx, Xilinx and Altera FPGAs with 
ARM cores, Cavium on MIPS. In most cases external buses are configurable 
and we have to address possible combinations.

I already posted some explanation in response to your earlier comment.

Explanations posted.

Highly likely it is used right now in a base station of mobile operator 
near you :)
