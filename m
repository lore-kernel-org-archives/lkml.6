FWIW, it does generate sane code and bulk rename itself is not hard.
What I've got is in vfs.git#work.poll:
      smc: missing poll annotations
      xen: fix poll misannotation
      use linux/poll.h instead of asm/poll.h
      add EPOLLNVAL, annotate EPOLL... and event_poll->event
      preparation to switching ->poll() to returning EPOLL...
      ep_send_events_proc(): return result via esed->res
      annotate ep_scan_ready_list()
      switch users of kernel-side POLL... to EPOLL...
      unify {de,}mangle_poll(), get rid of kernel-side POLL...
The first 7 commits are preparation, then mechanical bulk rename with
for V in IN OUT PRI ERR RDNORM RDBAND WRNORM WRBAND HUP RDHUP NVAL MSG; do
  L=`git grep -l -w POLL$V | grep -v '^t' | grep -v /um/ | grep -v '^sa' | grep -v '/poll.h$'|grep -v '^D'`
  for f in $L; do sed -i "-es/^\([^\"]*\)\(\<POLL$V\>\)/\\1E\\2/" $f; done
done
then consolidation of mangle_poll/demangle_poll and making those
ifndef __KERNEL__ poll.h unconditional.

FWIW, with the entire series applied __poll_t warnings (with CF=-D__CHECK_POLL)
are down to the following:

* genuine bugs in ->poll() instances, of the "return -EINVAL/-ERESTARTSYS/etc."
sort -

drivers/media/pci/bt8xx/bttv-driver.c:3347:20:    got restricted __poll_t [assigned] [usertype] res

drivers/media/pci/saa7134/saa7134-video.c:1243:19:    expected restricted __poll_t

* misannotations around perf ring_buffer->poll -
kernel/events/core.c:4541:24:    expected restricted __poll_t [usertype] events
kernel/events/ring_buffer.c:22:39:    got restricted __poll_t [usertype] <noident>

IOW, not much and fairly low on false positives.

Are you OK with that approach?  I could send a pull request for the first 7
in that series (it should be bisect-safe), then you'd run the bulk rename
script just before -rc1 and apply the last one on top of that.
