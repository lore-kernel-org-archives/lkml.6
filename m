This makes me wonder why kexec doesn't disable all interrupt sources by
itself instead of relying on the drivers shutdown routine. Some drivers
don't even have a shutdown callback. Kexec could have done both as another
example. Something like.

1. Call shutdown for all drivers if available.
2. Disable all interrupt sources in the interrupt controller
3. Start the new kernel.
