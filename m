So my understanding of overlayfs is pretty basic so I'm sorry if I miss
something. If I'm right, we have three superblocks here: ovl, upper, lower.
Now 'lower' is read-only so for freezing purposes we can just forget about
it. 'upper' is where the real changes are going into and 'ovl' is a wrapper
virtual superblock that handles merging of 'lower' and 'upper'. Correct so
far?

And the problem seems to be that when you acquire freeze protection for the
'ovl' superblock, you in fact want to acquire freeze protection for the
'upper' (as 'ovl' is just virtual and has no disk state to protect). So I
agree that a callback to allow overlayfs to acquire freeze protection on
'upper' right away would be one solution. Or we could make s_writers a
pointer and redirect ovl->s_writers to upper->s_writers. Then VFS should do
the right thing from the start unless overlayfs calls back into operations
on 'upper' that will try to acquire the freeze protection again. Thoughts?
