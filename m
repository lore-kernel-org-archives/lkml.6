I saw all this pop up in linux-next and got curious.

This changelog didn't uncurious me at all.  The
LOCK_DOWN_IN_EFI_SECURE_BOOT Kconfig help is unilluminating.  A bit of
googling led me to kernel_lockdown.7 (https://lwn.net/Articles/735564/)
which kinda helped.

But still.  This is a big, straggly feature and presumably is still
missing things and presumably will require ongoing maintenance as we
add new kernel capabilities.  What do we get in return for all of this?
What are the usecases for this feature and why would anyone want one? 
What's the value to our users?

Thanks.
