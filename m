OK, I'll try to separate these into two sets.

This will unfortunately trigger some changes (conflict resolving - e.g. if 
I move the last two patches in the current series forward, in front of the 
patches with new functionality). What is the proper procedure w.r.t. 
Reviewed-by tags which were already given? Common sense would make me keep 
them for trivial changes and remove them if the patch should be 
re-reviewed. Is that correct?

FWIW I also hacked together a tool to cover my usecase: 
https://gitlab.com/zub2/opalctl

The selling point is that it can handle passwords the same way that 
sedutil (https://github.com/Drive-Trust-Alliance/sedutil) does.
