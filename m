Hi Johan,

thank you very much for the review!

Ok. Will change that to GPL-2.0+

There was a comment from Marcel about this as well and I read it as: You
can do it, but it is not required and nobody really cares.
I included this, because the other pn532 phy driver (i2c) is doing it
this way, but I don't like it either, so I will drop this, as well as
the PN532_UART_DRIVER_NAME define in the next version.

Yes, good point. Also the variable name is misleading. I will change
that.

I will change it.

I did not see any during my tests, but you are right: It feels a bit
odd.
The i2c driver is also requesting irqs after registering.
The pn533_finalize_setup() has to be last.
I could do the serdev_* stuff before, but ...

Ok, i drop it.

... that would then be contrary to this idea.
Also I don't see how to implement it with what is there today. i2c also
does not do something similar.
It can be done with adding some callbacks from the core (pn533.c) driver
to it's phy drivers.
Wouldn't that be the scope of another later patch then ?

Thanks again,
Lars
