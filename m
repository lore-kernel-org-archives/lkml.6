There is no nvmem cell parsing at the moment. The DT lookup just
resolve the phandle to the cell node, take the parent node and search
for the nvmem provider that has this OF node. So extending it in case
the node has a *new* compatible string would not break users of the old
binding, none of them has a compatible string.

As long as that wouldn't prevent using DT in the future I'm fine with
it.

To be honest I also think that naming this concept "nvmem" in the DT was
a bad idea. Perhaps something like "driver-data" or "data-cell" would
have been better as that would make it clear what this is about, nvmem
is just the Linux implementation of this concept.

That would add another binding that allow free named child nodes
without compatible string although experience has repeatedly shown that
this was a bad idea.

Yes, however that's just an implementation limitation which is trivial
to solve.

There is a big difference. DT represent the hardware and the
relationship between the devices in an OS independent format. We don't
add extra stuff in there just to map back internal Linux API details.

Well, I think this is the best solution :/

What is not true in this statement? The current nvmem lookup don't care
about compatible strings, so the cell lookup would just works fine. The
MTD partition parser won't consider them as a partition because of the
compatible string. Problem solved!

Do note that undocumented bindings are not allowed. DTS that use
undocumented bindings (normally) just get rejected.

I'm fine with #1, I just didn't understood what it was useful for.

As I'm not a maintainer so I just can't block anything. But I won't lie
and pretend that I support a solution with known shortcomings.
