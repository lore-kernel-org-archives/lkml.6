I'd prefer not to talk about 'control program' here, as it is not a
term commonly used in Linux. Call it 'guest'?

Also, s/don't/doesn't/

I agree, this seems useful for now, but we really need to support the
different ida flags to be fully architecture compliant.

The second sentence is confusing (What is 'CP' referring to here?
'Control program' or struct channel_program?)

What about:

"As we don't want to fail direct addressing even if the orb specified
one of the unsupported formats, we defer checking for IDAWs in
unsupported formats to here."

The patch looks sane, I have only issues with the description/comments.
