Isn't it the other way around?  We want to check that all redistributors
(one for every VCPU) has its base address set?  (I don't suppose we care
about unused redistributor regions).

Do we need to check that again?  Didn't we check that at
creation/register time?

Shouldn't this be a kvm_debug instead?  I think the user can just
provoke this by failing to register enough redistributor regions.

I'm also wondering if we could check this on vgic_init time for gicv3,
which should have a defined vgic init ordering requirement.  That would
make debugging it slightly easier to debug than "my machine isn't
starting, and I get -ENXIO, and it can mean anything".
