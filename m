bow == backup on write

Similar to dm-snap, add the ability to take a snapshot of a device.
Unlike dm-snap, a separate volume is not required.

dm-bow can be in one of three states.

In state one, the free blocks on the device are identified by issuing
an FSTRIM to the filesystem.

In state two, any writes cause the overwritten data to be backup up
to the available free space. While in this state, the device can be
restored by unmounting the filesystem, removing the dm-bow device
and running a usermode tool over the underlying device.

In state three, the changes are committed, dm-bow is in pass-through
mode and the drive can no longer be restored.

It is planned to use this driver to enable restoration of a failed
update attempt on Android devices using ext4.

Test: Can boot Android with userdata mounted on this device. Can commit
userdata after SUW has run. Can then reboot, make changes and roll back.

Known issues:

Recovery tool needed

Remove BUG_ONs

Assumtion is that bios are always page aligned. This is not in general
true. Fix to work with file systems which use 1k blocks.

Mutex is held around entire flush operation, including lengthy I/O. Plan
is to convert to state machine with pending queues.

Add a linked list of free ranges to avoid linear searches of the tree.
Similarly sector0_current should be stored in bow_context. There should
be no linear searches of the map.

Interaction with block encryption is unknown, especially with respect
to sector 0.

+dm_bow (backup on write)
+========================
+
+dm_bow is a device mapper driver that uses the free space on a device to back up
+data that is overwritten. The changes can then be committed by a simple state
+change, or rolled back by removing the dm_bow device and running a command line
+utility over the underlying device.
+
+dm_bow has three states, set by writing ‘1’ or ‘2’ to /sys/block/dm-?/bow/state.
+It is only possible to go from state 0 (initial state) to state 1, and then from
+state 1 to state 2.
+
+State 0: dm_bow collects all trims to the device and assumes that these mark
+free space on the overlying file system that can be safely used. Typically the
+mount code would create the dm_bow device, mount the file system, call the
+FITRIM ioctl on the file system then switch to state 1. These trims are not
+propagated to the underlying device.
+
+TODO: There are some race conditions if there are writes in state 0. Test
+mounting the drive ro and see if trims are still allowed. If that fails, test
+holding all writes in a queue until we switch to state 1. If that fails,
+consider implementing a ram disk type affair, which will be complex and risky.
+
+State 1: All writes to the device cause the underlying data to be backed up to
+the free (trimmed) area as needed in such a way as they can be restored.
+However, the writes, with one exception, then happen exactly as they would
+without dm_bow, so the device is always in a good final state. The exception is
+that sector 0 is used to keep a log of the latest changes, both to indicate that
+we are in this state and to allow rollback. See below for all details.
+
+State 2: The transition to state 2 triggers replacing the special sector 0 with
+the normal sector 0, and the freeing of all state information. dm_bow then
+becomes a pass-through driver, allowing the device to continue to be used with
+minimal performance impact.
+
+Usage
+=====
+dm-bow takes one command line parameter, the name of the underlying device.
+
+dm-bow will typically be used in the following way. dm-bow will be loaded with a
+suitable underlying device and the resultant device will be mounted. A file
+system trim will be issued via the FITRIM ioctl, then the device will be
+switched to state 1. The file system will now be used as normal. At some point,
+the changes can either be committed by switching to state 2, or rolled back by
+unmounting the file system, removing the dm-bow device and running the command
+line utility. Note that rebooting the device will be equivalent to unmounting
+and removing, but the command line utility must still be run
+
+Details of operation in state 1
+===============================
+
+dm_bow maintains a type for all sectors. A sector can be any of:
+
+SECTOR0
+SECTOR0_CURRENT
+UNCHANGED
+FREE
+CHANGED
+BACKUP
+
+SECTOR0 is the first sector on the device, and is used to hold the log of
+changes. This is the one exception.
+
+SECTOR0_CURRENT is a sector picked from the FREE sectors, and is where reads and
+writes from the true sector zero are redirected to. Note that like any backup
+sector, if the sector is written to directly, it must be moved again.
+
+UNCHANGED means that the sector has not been changed since we entered state 1.
+Thus if it is written to or trimmed, the contents must first be backed up.
+
+FREE means that the sector was trimmed in state 0 and has not yet been written
+to or used for backup. On being written to, a FREE sector is changed to CHANGED.
+
+CHANGED means that the sector has been modified, and can be further modified
+without further backup.
+
+BACKUP means that this is a free sector being used as a backup. On being written
+to, the contents must first be backed up again.
+
+All backup operations are logged to the first sector. The log sector has the
+format:
+--------------------------------------------------------
+| Magic | Count | Sequence | Log entry | Log entry | …
+--------------------------------------------------------
+
+Magic is a magic number. Count is the number of log entries. Sequence is 0
+initially. A log entry is
+
+-----------------------------------
+| Source | Dest | Size | Checksum |
+-----------------------------------
+
+When SECTOR0 is full, the log sector is backup up and another empty log sector
+created with sequence number one higher. The first entry in any log entry with
+sequence > 0 therefore must be the log of the backing up of the previous log
+sector. Note that sequence is not strictly needed, but is a useful sanity check
+and potentially limits the time spent trying to restore a corrupted snapshot.
+
+On entering state 1, dm_bow has a list of free sectors. All other sectors are
+unchanged. Sector0_current is selected from the free sectors and the contents of
+sector 0 are copied there. The sector 0 is backed up, which triggers the first
+log entry to be written.
