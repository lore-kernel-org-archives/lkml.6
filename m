OK, I was considering DT constant, but it doesn't really matter as you
say since the input comes from a trusted environment and could subvert
the system in much more direct ways than blowing away the
decompressor's stack buffers if it wanted to.

By "this feature" do you mean stack protector? I still have a 4.7.3
for x86 around and -fstack-protector-all works fine on it. Not sure if
there are issues using stack protector with kernel, or on ARM, for
older GCCs. In any case defining __stack_chk_guard as initialized data
should work on any gcc version regardless of whether stack protector
is actually used; it doesn't require any compiler features just basic
C.
