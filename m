In my opinion, maybe it would be better to make
pci_sriov_configure_simple() always available
just like other sriov functions.

Based on the comments in the original patch:

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10353197/
"""
+/* this is expected to be used as a function pointer, just define as NULL */
+#define pci_sriov_configure_simple NULL
"""

This function could be defined as NULL just because
it was expected to be used as a function pointer.
But actually it could be called directly as a
function, just like this case.

So I prefer to make this function always available
just like other sriov functions.

Best regards,
