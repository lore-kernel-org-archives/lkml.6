Ok, then I'd suggest to check in pcie_init() whether the feature is
supported and enable it if so.  And store that fact in a flag, either
in struct pci_dev or struct controller.

Hm, this contradicts Austin Bolen's e-mail of Jan 25 that "Yes, this
platform disables in-band presence" (when asked whether your host
controller already adheres to the ECN).

Austin asked in an e-mail of Jan 24 whether "the hot-inserted device's
config space [is] accessed immediately after waiting this 20 + 100 ms
delay", which sounded to me like you'd prefer the device not to be
accessed until PDS is 1.  This can be achieved by polling PDS in
pcie_wait_for_link() if in-band presence is disabled, which is why
I suggested it.

I'm worried that amending pciehp_handle_presence_or_link_change() makes
the event handling logic more difficult to understand.  Polling PDS in
pcie_wait_for_link() or disabling either PDC or DLLSC if in-band presence
is disabled seems simpler to reason about.

I don't know, maybe inband_presence_disabled?

Thanks,

Lukas
