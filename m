Right, I overlook that "little" detail... :/

+1

Right, with the default conf yes.

While this should not happen, as I wrote in the RT integration patch,
that's happening because I'm missing some compilation guard or
similar. In this configurations we should always go to max... will
look into that.

Well, I think it's tricky to say whether the current or new approach
is better... it probably depends on the use-case.

Anyway... agree, it's just that to add some documentation I need to
get what you are pointing out ;)

Will come up with some additional text to be added to the changelog

Maybe we can add a more detailed explanation of the different
behaviors you can get in the EAS documentation which is coming to
mainline ?
