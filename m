Filesystem DAX now has a dependency on memory hotplug?

Fmeh. No wonder I never enabled CONFIG_ZONE_DEVICE. It's described in
menuconfig as "Device memory (pmem, HMM, etc...) hotplug support".
This isn't for hotplug support - it required for basic DAX
functionality. I've never enabled memory hotplug in any of my test
kernel configs, because the VMs I run the kernels on don't ever get
memory hotplugged....

OK, works now I've found the magic config incantantions to turn
everything I now need on.

Can we get this rationalised to a single top level config
option in the filesystems menu "Enable Filesystem DAX" that turns
on every knob that is required?

Cheers,

Dave.
