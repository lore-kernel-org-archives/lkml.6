Yes, that matches my calculations. But IMHO these 1.7% matter and
we should not give them up that easily.

Are you sure about that? The UBIFS TNC will first of all try to cache as
much as possible and I'd argue that most of the time the nodes required
for a hash will already be in memory. Even if we have to load the nodes
from memory, we could consider changing the cache semantics of the TNC
to optimize for that. Richard did some tests related to this at the UBI
level [1]. But that is something that we will have to evaluate once
we have a first PoC implementation of UBIFS authentication.

Anyways, I get what you mean and I agree that this is surely an optimization
worth pursuing! Also, note that the whole thing is rather a concept instead
of a detailed implementation guide, so there are bound to be things that
can be optimized. :)

Yep! :D
