You're right, sorry for missing that.

That's a good question.

As long as a VLA is used, it's probably fine, as chip->ngpio is quite small.
If you would change it to an array that can accommodate NR_GPIOS bits, you
have to start caring about recursion (e.g. gpio-74x164 driven from spi-gpio,
where I can extend the chain to increase the level of recursion arbitrarily).
