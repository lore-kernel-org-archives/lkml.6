So what happened with the request_firmware_nowarn() api (discussed in 
another thread). Did it get lost with your kidney stones ;-) ? It seems 
we start having the same discussion about the asynchronous variant as 
well here which is a bit counter productive.

Let's get back to the issue of the message above. So when is the message 
unnecessary. To me there are actually to cases in which the message can 
confuse people searching the log for hints on a issue they have with a 
device. 1) when the driver requests a sequence of files and only needs 
one, and 2) when the driver request can be handled by fallback. Why not 
only issue the error message when the device driver uses 
request_firmware_direct() or when there is no fallback.

Also this patch does not seem to be made against latest code as I did a 
major rework that went in v4.17-rc1.

I can not fully agree here. While being a bit more descriptive even with 
enums wrong enum values can be used due to copy-paste errors for 
instance. Also when reviewing code, sometime looking up function 
prototypes and type definitions are part of the fun. Tools like ctags or 
elixir website make it pretty easy.

Now regarding this part of the patch the driver is requesting nvram 
file, which is not always optional. For SDIO devices it is required and 
for PCIe it is optional so firmware.c module is instructed about this 
with a flag. So here that flag should be used to pass the proper 
boolean/call the appropriate function. Actually in the latest code the 
nvram is request synchronously.

This is requesting the actual firmware that is run by the cpu on the 
chip so it is not optional.

Again, the firmware.c module has been reworked quite a bit in v4.17-rc1 
so this patch is outdated.
