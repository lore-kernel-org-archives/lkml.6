Keith, while we're on this, regardless of cmb, is SQE memcopy and DB 
update ordering always guaranteed?

If you look at mlx4 (rdma device driver) that works exactly the same as
nvme you will find:
--
                 qp->sq.head += nreq;

                 /*
                  * Make sure that descriptors are written before
                  * doorbell record.
                  */
                 wmb();

                 writel(qp->doorbell_qpn,
                        to_mdev(ibqp->device)->uar_map + 
MLX4_SEND_DOORBELL);

                 /*
                  * Make sure doorbells don't leak out of SQ spinlock
                  * and reach the HCA out of order.
                  */
                 mmiowb();
--

That seems to explicitly make sure to place a barrier before updating
the doorbell. So as I see it, either ordering is guaranteed and the
above code is redundant, or nvme needs to do the same.

Thoughts?
