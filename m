We do what needs to be done. From what you are saying, your IP
implements a config 1 type header and that defines it as a PCI-to-PCI
bridge (eg a root port, of sorts).

The points you are making above are software, I understand them but
that's not what we are discussing here.

I want you to define the class of your IP according to what your IP
is and it seems _reasonable_ to me to define the IP as a PCI-to-PCI
bridge class from the information you are providing.

I would like you to:

1) Rewrite the commit log and explain why your IP needs class
   reprogramming. I do not care about driver software complexity,
   I want you to describe how HW works. I do not want you to define
   a class for your IP because that makes the driver simpler, I want
   you to define a class for your IP to describe to the kernel what
   that IP really is, which is different things.
2) Define and report the bug you are fixing in the commit log
3) Provide a Fixes: tag pointing at the faulty commit

Thanks for your time providing information.
