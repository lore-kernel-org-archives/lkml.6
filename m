You're right. The flag wouldn't be a good pattern for the long term.
I was thinking typically we wouldn't enable new features by default
in KVM, so this choice was geared towards getting mitigations and
compat support done quickly. Christoffer is probably right that we
could just backburn the compat stuff for now though.

Indeed, I should have elaborated on the fact that this is a how QEMU
does it now type of thing. While it would be possible to filter new
registers from the migration stream for the compat version, I guess
that would require much more work, and I was thinking of getting a
userspace solution out quickly after KVM gets these patches merged.
But, again, maybe that's not necessary.

We could protect the guest by adding kernel support to handle the
exception that old KVM would inject, I think. But, that would be
quite nasty.
