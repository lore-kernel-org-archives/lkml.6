No this is the non HMM case i am talking about here. Fully ignore HMM
in this frame. A GPU driver that do not support or use HMM in anyway
has all the properties and requirement i do list above. So all the points
i was making are without HMM in the picture whatsoever. I should have
posted this a separate patches to avoid this confusion.

Regarding your HMM question. You can not map HMM pages, all code path
that would try that would trigger a migration back to regular memory
and will use the regular memory for CPU access.

Again HMM has nothing to do here, ignore HMM it does not play any role
and it is not involve in anyway here. GPU want to control what object
they allow other device to access and object they do not allow. GPU driver
_constantly_ invalidate the CPU page table and in fact the CPU page table
do not have any valid pte for a vma that is an mmap of GPU device file
for most of the vma lifetime. Changing that would highly disrupt and
break GPU drivers. They need to control that, they need to control what
to do if another device tries to peer map some of their memory. Hence
why they need to implement the callback and decide on wether or not they
allow the peer mapping or use device memory for it (they can decide to
fallback to main memory).

If the exporter can not control than this is useless to GPU driver. I
would rather not exclude GPU driver from this.

Jérôme
