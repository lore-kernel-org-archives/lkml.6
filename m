What I do not understand is why the workqueue notification can't be called
irrespective of the linkup notifier value from pci_epf_test_bind(),
what's the point in calling it earlier with pci_epf_linkup() (or the
other way around why is it safe to call it a bind() time if there
is no notification available - which is the DW case).

They are platform dependent because they depend on the EP controller.
That's why I said that those are EP controller parameters. I do not
think they are module parameters either - they should be part of HW
description in firmware.
