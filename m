I think that is correct: the compiler won't reorder those because of the
'volatile' pointer dereference, but it can reorder access to a normal
pointer against a __raw_readl()/__raw_writel(), which breaks the scenario
of using writel to trigger a DMA, or using a readl to see if a DMA has
completed.

The question is whether we should use a stronger barrier such
as rmb() amd wmb() here rather than a simple compiler barrier.

I would assume that on complex architectures with write buffers and
out-of-order prefetching, those are required, while on architectures
without those features, the barriers are cheap.
