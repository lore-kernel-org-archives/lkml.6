(assuming you meant v8 -> v9) yes thanks for your reviews! Much
appreciated.

Yep, Serge came up with a pretty neat trick that we used in LXD to
accomplish sending mounts to containers, but it requires some
coordination up front.

Right, I guess the point here is just "you need to copy all the data
to the tracer *before* making a policy decision".

Yep, I'll fix this, thanks. But also this documentation should really
live in the seccomp patch; some rebase got screwed up somewhere.

Yes, in fact the sample code does use /proc/$pid/mem, but the docs
should be correct :)

I don't know actually, I just thought better safe than sorry. I can

No, I just flubbed the list API.

I think so, the idea being that you might want to do something
different if a signal was sent. But Andy seemed to think that we might
not actually do anything different.

Either way, for the case you describe, EINPROGRESS is a little weird.
Perhaps it should be:

if (knotif->state == SECCOMP_NOTIFY_INIT) {
        ret = -EBUSY; /* or something? */
        goto out;
} else if (knotif->state == SECCOMP_NOTIFY_REPLIED) {
        ret = -EINPROGRESS;
        goto out;
}

?

Yep, will do.

I suppose so, since we aren't going to let you reply to them anyway.

I think Kees replied already, but yes, this is a good point :(. We can
continue in his thread.

Sure, will do.

Will do, thanks.

I suppose so, given that we have last_locked.
