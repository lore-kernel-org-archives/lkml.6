Yes, GPUs seem to be leading the pack in implementing ATS.  So now the
dumb question, why not simply turn off the IOMMU and thus ACS?  The
argument of using the IOMMU for security is rather diminished if we're
specifically enabling devices to poke one another directly and clearly
this isn't favorable for device assignment either.  Are there target
systems where this is not a simple kernel commandline option?  Thanks,

Alex
