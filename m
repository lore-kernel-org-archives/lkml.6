Good question.  I think this sort of code definitely should not be in
drivers unless it's to work around some kind of defect in the device.

I think the intent of the spec is that neither the OS nor the driver
has to deal with link training and the link should train to the
highest speed supported by both ends.  For example, PCIe r4.0, sec 1.2
says

  Initialization – During hardware initialization, each PCI Express
  Link is set up following a negotiation of Lane widths and frequency
  of operation by the two agents at each end of the Link. No firmware
  or operating system software is involved.

Maybe the Intel guys can comment on why HFI needs this code.
Presumably they didn't write it just for fun, so I assume there's
some reason.
