So the question is:

P0()
{
	WRITE_ONCE(x, 1);
	smp_store_release(&y, 1);
	r0 = smp_load_acquire(&y);
	WRITE_ONCE(z, 1);
}

P1()
{
	r1 = READ_ONCE(z);
	smp_rmb();
	r2 = READ_ONCE(x);
}

exists: r0 == 1 /\ r1==1 /\ r2==0

Which per the current LKMM would be forbidden? How would strict RCpc
allow that? Due to a fwd from the release to the acquire and then
defeating the ordering or something like that?

My vote would go to disallowing this. Allowing this would be rather
subtle and unexpected IMO.
