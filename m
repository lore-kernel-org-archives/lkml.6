Hi Jason,

Apologies for starting a new thread, but this patch apparently wasn't
Cc'ed to linux-crypto, despite adding over 24000 lines of crypto code.
So much for WireGuard being only 4000 lines :-)

(For anyone else like me who didn't receive the patch, it can be found at
https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/951763/)

I have some preliminary comments below.

In general this is great work, and I'm very excited for WireGuard to be
upstreamed!  But for the new crypto code, I think a few things are on
the wrong track, for example treating it is a special library.  Even the
name is contradicting itself: Zinc is "not crypto/", yet as you stated
it's intended that the "Zinc" algorithms will be exposed through the
crypto API -- just like how most of the existing crypto code in lib/ is
also exposed through the crypto API.  So, I think that what you're doing
isn't actually *that* different from what already exists in some cases;
and pretending that it is very different is just going to cause
problems.  Rather, the actual truly new thing seems to be that the
dispatch to architecture specific implementations is done at the lib/
level instead of handled by the crypto API priority numbers.

So, I don't see why you don't just add lib/blake2s/, lib/chacha20/,
lib/poly1305/, etc., without pretending that they all have some special
new "Zinc" thing in common and are part of some holy crusade against the
crypto API.

They could even still go in subdirectory lib/crypto/ -- but just for
logical code organization purposes, as opposed to a special library with
a name that isn't self-explanatory and sounds like some third-party
library rather than first-class kernel code.

CONFIG_ZINC also needs to go.  Algorithms will need to be independently
configurable as soon as anything other than WireGuard needs to use any
of them, so you might as well do it right from the start with
CONFIG_BLAKE2, CONFIG_CHACHA20, CONFIG_POLY1305, etc.

I think the above changes would also naturally lead to a much saner
patch series where each algorithm is added by its own patch, rather than
one monster patch that adds many algorithms and 24000 lines of code.

Note that adding all the algorithms in one patch also makes the
description of them conflated, e.g. you wrote that "formally verified"
implementations were used whenever possible, but AFAICS that actually
only applies to the C implementations of Curve25519, and even those have
your copyright statement so presumably you had to change something from
the "formally verified" code :-).  Note also that Poly1305
implementations are somewhat error-prone, since there can be overflow
bugs that are extremely rarely hit; see e.g. how OpenSSL's Poly1305 NEON
implementation was initially buggy and had to be fixed:
https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-commits/2016-April/006639.html.
Not to mention that C glue code is error-prone, especially with the tons
of #ifdefs.  So, I'd strongly prefer that you don't oversell the crypto
code you're adding, e.g. by implying that most of it is formally
verified, as it likely still has bugs, like any other code...

I also want to compare the performance of some of the assembly
implementations you're adding to the existing implementations in the
kernel they duplicate.  I'm especially interested in the NEON
implementation of ChaCha20.  But adding 11 implementations in one single
patch means there isn't really a chance to comment on them individually.

Also, earlier when I tested OpenSSL's ChaCha NEON implementation on ARM
Cortex-A7 it was actually quite a bit slower than the one in the Linux
kernel written by Ard Biesheuvel... I trust that when claiming the
performance of all implementations you're adding is "state-of-the-art
and unrivaled", you actually compared them to the ones already in the
Linux kernel which you're advocating replacing, right? :-)

Your patch description is also missing any mention of crypto accelerator
hardware.  Quite a bit of the complexity in the crypto API, such as
scatterlist support and asynchronous execution, exists because it
supports crypto accelerators.  AFAICS your new APIs cannot support
crypto accelerators, as your APIs are synchronous and operate on virtual
addresses.  I assume your justification is that "djb algorithms" like
ChaCha and Poly1305 don't need crypto accelerators as they are fast in
software.  But you never explicitly stated this and discussed the
tradeoffs.  Since this is basically the foundation for the design you've
chosen, it really needs to be addressed.

As for doing the architecture-specific dispatch in lib/ rather than
through the crypto API, there definitely are some arguments in favor of
it.  The main problem, though, is that your code is a mess due to all
the #ifdefs, and it will only get worse as people add more
architectures.  You may think you already added all the architectures
that matter, but tomorrow people will come and want to add PowerPC,
RISC-V, etc.  I really think you should consider splitting up
implementations by architecture; this would *not*, however, preclude the
implementations from still being accessed through a single top-level
"glue" function.  For example chacha20() could look like:

void chacha20(struct chacha20_ctx *state, u8 *dst, const u8 *src, u32 len,
	      bool have_simd)
{
	if (chacha20_arch(dst, src, len, state->key, state->counter, have_simd))
		goto out;

	chacha20_generic(dst, src, len, state->key, state->counter);

out:
	state->counter[0] += (len + 63) / 64;
}

So, each architecture would optionally define its own chacha20_arch()
that returns true if the data was processed, or false if not.  (The data
wouldn't be processed if, for example, 'have_simd' was false but only
SIMD implementations are available; or if the input was too short for an
SIMD implementation to be faster than the generic one.)  Note that this
would make the code much more consistent with the usual Linux kernel
coding style, which strongly prefers calling functions unconditionally
rather than having core logic littered with unmaintainable #ifdefs.

I'd also strongly prefer the patchset to include converting the crypto
API versions of ChaCha20 and Poly1305 over to use your new lib/ code, to
show that it's really possible.  You mentioned that it's planned, but if
it's not done right away there will be things that were missed and will
require changes when someone finally does it.  IMO it's not acceptable
to add your own completely separate ChaCha20 and Poly1305 just because
you don't like that the existing ones are part of the crypto API.  You
need to refactor things properly.  I think you'd need to expose the new
code under a cra_driver_name like "chacha20-software" and
"poly1305-software" to reflect that they use the fastest available
implementation of the algorithm on the CPU, e.g. "chacha20-generic",
"chacha20-neon", and "chacha20-simd" would all be replaced by a single
"chacha20-software".  Is that what you had in mind?

I'm also wondering about the origin and licensing of some of the
assembly language files.  Many have an OpenSSL copyright statement.
But, the OpenSSL license is often thought to be incompatible with GPL,
so using OpenSSL assembly code in the kernel has in the past required
getting special permission from Andy Polyakov (the person who's written
most of OpenSSL's assembly code so holds the copyright on it).  As one
example, see arch/arm/crypto/sha256-armv4.pl: the file explicitly states
that Andy has relicensed it under GPLv2.  For your new OpenSSL-derived
files, have you gone through and explicitly gotten GPLv2 permission from
Andy / the copyright holders?

Each assembly language file should also explicitly state where it came
from.  For example lib/zinc/curve25519/curve25519-arm.S has your
copyright statement and says it's "Based on algorithms from Daniel J.
Bernstein and Peter Schwabe.", but it's not clarified whether the *code*
was written by those other people, as opposed to those people designing
the *algorithms* and then you writing the code; and if you didn't write
it, where you retrieved the file from and when, what license it had
(even if it was "public domain" like some of djb's code, this should be
mentioned for informational purposes), and what changes you made if any.

Oh, and please use 80-character lines like the rest of the kernel, so
that people's eyes don't bleed when reading your code :-)

Thanks for all your hard work on WireGuard!
