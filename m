I just reviewed the code again, and I am sure that we cannot merge this
patch. Enabling the btcoex parameter makes the driver enable a whole
bunch of code starting timers, listening to some GPIOs, etc.

On non-btcoex systems, some of those GPIOs might be floating or even
connected to different things, which could cause a lot of undefined
behavior.

This is simply too big a risk, so there absolutely needs to be a
whitelist for systems that need this, otherwise it has to remain
disabled by default.
