I see your point. I have bypassed the problem by doing the module load/unload
(to avoid having to fight on multiple fronts).

I like your suggestion. Maybe we could have a bool variable for each BARs that
could be set to false if a resource have intent to use it.

However this change must be accepted by Kishon.
