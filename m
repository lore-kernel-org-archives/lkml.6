GPU driver must be in control and must be call to. Here there is 2 cases
in this patchset and i should have instead posted 2 separate patchset as
it seems that it is confusing things.

For the HMM page, the physical address of the page ie the pfn does not
correspond to anything ie there is nothing behind it. So the importing
device has no idea how to get a valid physical address from an HMM page
only the device driver exporting its memory with HMM device memory knows
that.


For the special vma ie mmap of a device file. GPU driver do manage their
BAR ie the GPU have a page table that map BAR page to GPU memory and the
driver _constantly_ update this page table, it is reflected by invalidating
the CPU mapping. In fact most of the time the CPU mapping of GPU object are
invalid they are valid only a small fraction of their lifetime. So you
_must_ have some call to inform the exporting device driver that another
device would like to map one of its vma. The exporting device can then
try to avoid as much churn as possible for the importing device. But this
has consequence and the exporting device driver must be allow to apply
policy and make decission on wether or not it authorize the other device
to peer map its memory. For GPU the userspace application have to call
specific API that translate into specific ioctl which themself set flags
on object (in the kernel struct tracking the user space object). The only
way to allow program predictability is if the application can ask and know
if it can peer export an object (ie is there enough BAR space left).

Moreover i would like to be able to use this API between GPUs that are
inter-connected between each other and for those the CPU page table are
just invalid and the physical address to use are only meaning full to the
exporting and importing device. So again here core kernel has no idea of
what the physical address would be.


So in both cases, at very least for GPU, we do want total control to be
given to the exporter.

For GPU the BAR address space is manage page by page and thus you do not
want to map a range of BAR addresses but you want to allow mapping of
multiple page of BAR address that are not adjacent to each other nor
ordered in anyway. But providing helper for simpler device does make sense.
