Thanks for the details!

This one *should* be fixed by this patch:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/helgaas/pci.git/commit/?h=pci/virtualization&id=bf6c089ee2ac67eb22c0ff0ac9cc7f9ccd619d90

Any chance you could try that out?

This one sounds like we're missing something in this path:

  pci_read_config
    pci_config_pm_runtime_get
      if (parent)
        pm_runtime_get_sync
          __pm_runtime_resume(dev, RPM_GET_PUT)
            rpm_resume

It *looks* like rpm_resume() should resume parent devices, i.e., the
root port, but I don't know that code at all.  Maybe Rafael or Lukas
could confirm that?

pci_config_pm_runtime_get() knows that config space is always
accessible unless the device is in D3cold, so if the target device is
in D3hot, it will leave it there.  I assume that if/when rpm_resume()
resumes the parent bridges, it will resume them all the way to D0.

I'm *really* glad you're finding these issues, because on most
platforms we would just silently read invalid data (all ones) and the
caller would have no idea what's going wrong.
