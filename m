I thought we required userspace to register the redist regions before
initializing the vgic, but if there is no defined order there, then
fine.

(Although I'm getting the feeling we should have been more strict on our
ordering requirement, and that the whole "you can create anything you
want in any order you want" makes the kernel implementation really
complex.  I may be reversing my own oppinion on this matter here.)
