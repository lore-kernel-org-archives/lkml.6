Thanks for the reminder - it's coming back to me now.

And looking again at the code, it doesn't seem so bad.  I was worried
about reassigning ci.io->orig_bio after calling
__split_and_process_non_flush(), but the important thing is to set it
before the last dec_pending() call, and the code gets that right.

I think I've found the problem though:

			/* done with normal IO or empty flush */
			bio->bi_status =3D io_error;

When we have chained bios, there are multiple sources for error which
need to be merged into bi_status:  all bios that were chained to this
one, and this bio itself.

__bio_chain_endio uses:

	if (!parent->bi_status)
		parent->bi_status =3D bio->bi_status;

so the new status won't over-ride the old status (unless there are
races....), but dm doesn't do that - I guess it didn't have to worry
about chains before.

So this:

diff --git a/drivers/md/dm.c b/drivers/md/dm.c
index d6de00f367ef..68136806d365 100644
=2D-- a/drivers/md/dm.c
+++ b/drivers/md/dm.c
@@ -903,7 +903,8 @@ static void dec_pending(struct dm_io *io, blk_status_t =
error)
 			queue_io(md, bio);
 		} else {

=2D			bio->bi_status =3D io_error;
+			if (io_error)
+				bio->bi_status =3D io_error;
 			bio_endio(bio);
 		}
 	}

should fix it.  And __bio_chain_endio should probably be

diff --git a/block/bio.c b/block/bio.c
index e1708db48258..ad77140edc6f 100644
=2D-- a/block/bio.c

=2D	if (!parent->bi_status)
+	if (bio->bi_status)
 		parent->bi_status =3D bio->bi_status;
 	bio_put(bio);
 	return parent;

to remove the chance that a race will hide a real error.

Milan: could you please check that the patch fixes the dm-crypt bug?
I've confirmed that it fixes your test case.
When you confirm, I'll send a proper patch.

I guess I should audit all code that assigns to ->bi_status and make
sure nothing ever assigns 0 to it.

Thanks,
NeilBrown
