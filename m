There is an update to the SCSI Generic (sg) v4 driver adding synchronous
and asynchronous bidi command support. Plus lots of fixes and some minor
improvements. See:
     http://sg.danny.cz/sg/sg_v40.html

The kernel code is split in two in the tarball below, one targeting
lk 5.0 and the other targeting lk 4.20 and earlier ***. Each section
contains the 3 files that represent the sg v4 driver plus a meandering
17 part patchset. Those patchsets reflect the driver's rewrite rather
than a logical progression.
     http://sg.danny.cz/sg/p/sgv4_20190116.tgz

Plus there are updated testing utilities in sg3_utils-1.45 (beta,
revision 807) at the top of this page:
    http://sg.danny.cz/sg/index.html

Doug Gilbert


*** the reason for the split is the tree wide change to the access_ok()
     function.
