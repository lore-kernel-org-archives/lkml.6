Interesting.

Same for me.

Yes, sparse is supposed to warn in such cases and the __force is there
to quiets the warning when it is known that the cast is in fact correct.

The man page is not very clear here. It must be understood in the context
where each use of '__bitwise' will create a new *distinct* type.
Given this and the normal type checking, sparse should warn
"on any conversion of one restricted type into another *or* between a
restricted and the corresponding plain/unrestricted type" (or consider
that an 'unrestricted type' is 'a restricted type with no restriction',
which is, I think, what was meant here).

The fact that sparse doesn't warn in your case is clearly a bug in
sparse's type checking.
