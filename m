I assume you want to exclude Root Ports because of multi-function
devices and the "route to self" error.  I was hoping for a reference
to that so I could learn more about it.

While I was looking for it, I found sec 6.12.1.2 (PCIe r4.0), "ACS
Functions in SR-IOV Capable and Multi-Function Devices", which seems
relevant.  It talks about "peer-to-peer Requests (between Functions of
the device)".  Thay says to me that multi-function devices can DMA
between themselves.

I agree that peers need to have a common upstream bridge.  I think
you're saying peers need to have *two* common upstream bridges.  If I
understand correctly, requiring two common bridges is a way to ensure
that peers directly below Root Ports don't try to DMA to each other.

So I guess the first order of business is to nail down whether peers
below a Root Port are prohibited from DMAing to each other.  My
assumption, based on 6.12.1.2 and the fact that I haven't yet found
a prohibition, is that they can.

If you're looking for a common upstream bridge, you don't need to make
assumptions about whether the hierarchy is conventional PCI or PCIe or
how many levels are in the hierarchy.

You already have upstream_bridges_match(), which takes two pci_devs.
I think it should walk up the PCI hierarchy from the first device,
checking whether the bridge at each level is also a parent of the
second device.
