So __builtin_constant_p on an actual ICE always fold immediately to 1.
Looking at the gcc history, that seems to have been there since at least
2000, but likely forever. And when it's the controlling expression of a
ternary, it's apparently a stronger 1 than a literal 1:

int foo(int);
#define SIZE (1<<10)
#define half(x) (__builtin_constant_p(x) ? (x)>>1 : foo(x))
int bla[half(SIZE)];
int bla2[1 ? 123 : foo(3)+2];

on godbolt.org, gcc 4.1 and gcc4.4 are perfectly happy with this, but
newer gccs complain

  error: variably modified 'bla2' at file scope.

Argh.

It's a bit ugly, but I suppose one could keep a __builtin_constant_p()
check in the not-ICE-branch, so there's really three cases (ICE,
constant due to various optimizations, really not known at compile
time). But don't we use gcc's intrinsics for fls when available, so that
gcc should be able to know the semantics of __builtin_fls(some-constant)
and hence evaluate that itself at compile time?

Somewhat unrelated, we should probably move the __is_constexpr helper
from kernel.h to some more basic compiler header, to avoid cyclic header
dependencies.
