All the above sound well but that's mostly a guideline on what a C
library can do. It doesn't help much with defining the kernel ABI.
Anyway, it's good to clarify the use-cases.

I lost track of the context of this thread but if it's just about
relaxing the ABI for hwasan, the kernel has no idea of the compiler
generated structures in user space, so nothing is checked.

If we talk about tags in the context of MTE, than yes, with the current
proposal the tag would be checked by copy_*_user() functions.

With aio* (and synchronous iovec-based syscalls), the kernel may access
the memory while the corresponding user process is scheduled out. Given
that such access is not done in the context of the user process (and
using the user VA like copy_*_user), the kernel cannot handle potential
tag faults. Moreover, the transfer may be done by DMA and the device
does not understand tags.

I'd like to keep tags as a property of the pointer in a specific virtual
address space. The moment you convert it to a different address space
(e.g. kernel linear map, physical address), the tag property is stripped
and I don't think we should re-build it (and have it checked).

I don't think mprotect() over differently tagged pages was ever a
problem. I originally asked that mprotect() and friends do not accept
tagged pointers since these functions deal with memory ranges rather
than dereferencing such pointer (the reason being minimal kernel
changes). However, given how complicated it is to specify an ABI, I came
to the conclusion that a pointer passed to such function should be
allowed to have non-zero top byte. It would be the kernel's
responsibility to strip it out as appropriate.
