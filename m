OK. Isn't virtio-balloon good enough for us? 

Removing EPC is not consistent with hardware behaviour, but if you really want to support then should also be fine since we are not strictly following HW spec anyway.

You are right. I forgot this one.

KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID is the one. I don't think KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID require creating vcpu prior, since it is global thing that platform  supports. No?

But guest is aware of SGX and EPC so I don't see why it cannot be exposed to L2 even with private slot.

But that doesn't matter. I agree with you letting Qemu create EPC slots is probably better since we can support multiple EPC  better (and potential EPC removal if needed).

I agree.
