That doesn't matter. You have a single driver for all/most of the
clocks, so the driver can't be removed.

Deferred probe helps for inter-device dependencies, but I am more
concerned about timing of trying to register clocksources, irqchips,
etc. What happens if we probe drivers before the infrastructure is
initialized?
