I'm not sure, that predates me.  HEST does have a FIRMWARE_FIRST flag, but
spec does not say anymore on relation to _OSC control or AER capability.
Nothing in PCIe spec either.

I also don't know why Linux disables the AER driver if only one
device has a FIRMWARE_FIRST HEST. Shouldn't that just be a per-device
decision?

And why doesn't Linux do anything with _OSC response other than logging
it? If OS control wasn't granted, shouldn't that take priority over HEST?
