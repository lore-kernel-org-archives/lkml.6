I agree that a per-mm state is more optimal but I would rather fix the
issue in a clear way first and only then think about an optimization on
top. Queueing based on mark_oom_victim (whatever that uses to guarantee
the victim is marked atomically and only once) makes sense from the
conceptual point of view and it makes a lot of sense to start from
there. MMF_UNSTABLE has a completely different purpose. So unless you
see a correctness issue with that then I would rather go that way.
