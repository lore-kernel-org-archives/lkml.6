I've applied the series to my asm-generic tree now, I will give it a few days
in linux-next to see if any obvious regressions happen, and then send
a pull request.

Checking the list of architectures that are affected by this, I see
h8300, microblaze, nios2, openrisc, s390, sparc, um, unicore32,
and xtensa, all of which use asm-generic/io.h without overriding
the default readl/writel.

I would guess that at least s390 doesn't need the barriers
(maintainers on Cc now), but there may be others that want to
override the new barriers with weaker ones where an MMIO
access is guaranteed to serialize against DMA, or where
a specialized barrier for this case exists.

Looking over the asm-generic implementation once more now,
I wonder if we should change the relaxed accessors to not have
any barriers (back to the version before your series) rather than
defaulting them to having the same barriers as the regular
readl/writel.
