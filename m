For the record, I installed Windows 7 to one of the affected board.
The Intel GPU driver is not installed, so Windows is using the
standard VGA driver. Unplug/plug the VGA cable does not crash Windows,
nor did I notice anything abnormal. Since I have no idea how Windows
is handling any spurious interrupt, I cannot tell whether Windows does
anything special in the background to make it be "normal".

Good idea.
