I am sorry that I didn't join the discussion for the previous version
but time just didn't allow that. So sorry if I am repeating something
already sorted out.

There was a deliberate decision to keep hugetlb and "normal" memory
cgroup controllers separate. Mostly because hugetlb memory is an
artificial memory subsystem on its own and it doesn't fit into the rest
of memcg accounted memory very well. I believe we want to keep that
status quo.

Well such a usecase requires an explicit configuration already. Either
by using special wrappers or modifying the code. So I would argue that
you have quite a good knowlege of the setup. If you need a greater
flexibility then just do not use hugetlb at all and rely on THP.

I do not really think this is a good idea. We really do not want to make
the current hugetlb code more complex than it is already. The current
hugetlb cgroup controller is simple and works at least somehow. I would
not add more on top unless there is a _really_ strong usecase behind.
Please make sure to describe such a usecase in details before we even
start considering the code.

Well, then I would argue that you shouldn't use 64kB pages for your
setup or allow THP for smaller sizes. Really hugetlb pages are by no
means a substitute here.
