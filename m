Hello Kishon,

Since 32-bit BARs work fine on 64-bit CPUs,
and since 64-bit BARs work fine on 32 bit CPUs
(as long as we assign them an address <4G,
and their (combined) size is not too big),
perhaps the best way would be if pci-epf-test always defaults to 32-bit BARs,
and a module parameter says if we should test 64-bit BARs.

Just because a 64-bit BAR can be assigned an address >4G,
and have a size >4G, doesn't mean that we have to give it those properties.

This way we can have some testing of 64-bit BARs on 32-bit CPUs,
even though more extensive testing (e.g. having a BAR with a size >4G)
would require a 64-bit CPU.


Regards,
Niklas
