Because 'write-anywhere' exploits are easier than (and the typical first
step to) arbitrary code execution thingies?

The current patch set does not achieve that because it uses a global
address space for the alias mapping (vmap) which is equally accessible
from all CPUs.

The proposed implementation needs page-tables for the alias; I don't see
how you could ever do R/O page-tables when you need page-tables to
modify your page-tables.

And this is entirely irrespective of performance.

Oh, right, that CR0.WP stuff.

Right... /me goes find the patches we did for text_poke. Hmm, those
never seem to have made it:

  https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20180902173224.30606-1-namit@vmware.com

like that. That approach will in fact work and not be a completely
broken mess like this thing.

Doing 2 CR3 writes for 'every' WR write doesn't seem like it would be
fast enough for much of anything.

And I don't suppose we can take the WP fault and then fix up from there,
because if we're doing R/O page-tables, that'll incrase the fault depth
and we'll double fault all the time, and tripple fault where we
currently double fault. And we all know how _awesome_ tripple faults
are.

But duplicating (and wrapping in gunk) whole APIs is just not going to
work.
