I did not wanted to clutter patchset with device driver specific usage
of this. As the API can be reason about in abstract way.

HMM code is just one user, if you have a driver that use HMM mirror
then your driver get support for this for free. If you do not want to
use HMM then you can directly call this in your driver.

The flow is, device driver want to setup some mapping for a range of
virtual address [va_start, va_end]:
    1 - Lookup vma for the range
    2 - If vma is regular vma (not an mmap of a file) then use GUP
        If vma is a mmap of a file and they are p2p_map call back
        then call p2p_map()
    3 - Use either the result of GUP or p2p_map() to program the
        device

The p2p test function is use by device driver implementing the call
back for instance see:

https://cgit.freedesktop.org/~glisse/linux/commit/?h=hmm-p2p&id=401a567696eafb1d4faf7054ab0d7c3a16a5ef06

The vm_fault callback is not suited because here we are mapping to
another device so this will need special handling, someone must have
both device struct pointer in end and someone must be allow to make
decission on what to allow and what not to allow.

Moreover exporting driver like GPU driver might have complex policy
in place for which they will only allow export of some memory to a
peer device but not other.

In the end it means that it easier and simpler to add new call back
specificaly for that, so the intention is clear to both the caller
and the callee. The exporting device can then do the proper check
using the core helper (ie checking that the device can actually peer
to each other) and if that works it can then decide wether or not
it wants to allow this other device to access its memory or if it
prefer to use main memory for this.

To add this to the fault callback we would need to define a bunch
of new flags, setup fake page table so that we can populate pte and
then have the importing device re-interpret everything specialy
because it comes from another device. It would look ugly and it
would need to modify bunch of core mm code.

Note that this callback solution also allow an exporting device to
allow peer access while CPU can not access the memory ie the pte
entry for the range are pte_none.

Cheers,
Jérôme
