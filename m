Subject: [PATCH RFC] mmc: sdhci: Don't get card-detect without preemption
Date: Tue,  1 May 2018 16:47:21 -0700

For a controller with SDHCI_QUIRK_NO_CARD_NO_RESET, there are several
conditions where sdhci_do_reset is called under a spinlock with interrupts
disabled. The card detect is often a GPIO, which might sleep. Avoid
asking for the card detect status if interrupts are disabled to prevent
a warning like the following:

I discovered this warning while trying to bring up SD, somewhat unsuccessfully,
on a new device, and hit this error path.

This change is not ideal as it only makes a best effort to adhere to the quirk,
but may in some cases end up resetting the controller with no card present.

Another option I considered was trying to call sdhci_do_reset within only
sleepable contexts. I actually got as far as converting the tasklet to a
work queue, and deferring the reset to the end of the function in
sdhci_request_done. But 1) I'm not sure if that deferral was actually safe,
and 2) we call sdhci_do_reset from under the lock in several other places,
such as sdhci_card_event and sdhci_cqe_disable.

Finally, I also considered calling the non-_maysleep gpio functions in
mmc_gpio_get_cd. I assume this is not workable as someone somewhere has put
a card detect off of a PMIC or GPIO expander.

Any advice?
