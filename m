I think we should remove these, unless you have an imminent patch queued up
where you're about to use them. The register definitions in patch 1 are one
thing, as those were nice info to have and difficult to derive later
without certain documents. But these byte functions could be easily added
again by anyone if they're needed. So I don't think they have value now.
