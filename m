For the sake of robustness, I think it makes sense to at least handle 
all LDR/LDRH/LDRB encodings which might possibly fall out of a 
read[lwb]() call. Given that we seem to have various versions of this 
decoding in differing states of completeness, perhaps it's even worth 
factoring out into some kind of common "Arm PCI synchronous abort handler".

Oops, that's just me being dumb - I managed to overlook the pt_regs 
assignment in the second if() block and thought it was just advancing 
the PC, so assumed (because I also didn't bother to actually look up the 
relevant encoding bits) it must be handling stores. Never mind that part 
then.

Yeah, hopefully the linux-pci audience can clear up that one.

I was thinking in terms of whether we might need a combined handler with 
a runtime "thumb_mode(regs)" check rather than a compile-time decision, 
but Russell has a good point that just reading the instruction at all is 
its own can of worms in that case.

Robin.
