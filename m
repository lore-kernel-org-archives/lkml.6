This fails the build :(

drivers/video/console/vgacon.c:1432:15: error: initialization from incompatible pointer type [-Werror=incompatible-pointer-types]
  .con_putcs = vgacon_putcs,
               ^~~~~~~~~~~~

What tree should this go to?  It doesn't apply at all to my tty tree,
which is where I thought it should go, so I tried a different one and
