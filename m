I suspect that it is a head and/or log tail pointer overflow, so when it
tries to do the first trans reserve of the mount - to write the
unmount record - it says "no log space available, please wait".

And this comes back to my repeated comments about fuzzers needing
to fuzz properly made V5 filesystems as we catch and error out on
things like this. Fuzzing random collections of v4 filesystem
fragments will continue to trip over problems we've avoided with v5
filesystems, and this is further evidence to point to that.

I'd suggest that at this point, syzbot XFS reports should be
redirected to /dev/null. It's not worth our time to triage
unreviewed bot generated bug reports until the syzbot developers
start listening and acting on what we have been telling them
about fuzzing filesystems and reproducing bugs that are meaningful
and useful to us.

Cheers,

Dave.
