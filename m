All userspace API to enable p2p happens after object creation and in
some case they are mutable ie you can decide to no longer share the
object (userspace application decision). The BAR address space is a
resource from GPU driver point of view and thus from userspace point
of view. As such decissions that affect how it is use an what object
can use it, can change over application lifetime.

This is why i would like to allow kernel driver to apply any such
access policy, decided by the application on its object (on top of
which the kernel GPU driver can apply its own policy for GPU resource
sharing by forcing some object to main memory).

GPU can hang and all data becomes _undefined_, it can also be suspended
to save power (think laptop with discret GPU for instance). GPU threads
can be kill ... So they are few cases i can think of where either you
want to kill the p2p mapping and make sure the importer is aware and
might have a change to report back through its own userspace API, or
at very least fallback to dummy pages. In some of the above cases, for
instance suspend, you just want to move thing around to allow to shut
down device memory.

Yes it does.

Ok i will add a flag field in next post. GPU could allow pin but they
would most likely use main memory for any such object, hence it is no
longer really p2p but at least both device look at the same data.
