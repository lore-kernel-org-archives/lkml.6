Thanks! Btwn, I had tested the code in db410c.

Will update the comments.

After the IO_PAD_PWR_SWTCH is enabled, we will call 
sdhci_msm_handle_pwr_irq. If there is any pending power irq interrupt, 
that will set the appropriate pwr switch value. Otherwise, an 
appropriate value will get set during REQ_BUS_ON event.
