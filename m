My suggestion is to look at the problem and it's requirements and figure
out how to safely remove gc_thresh3 entirely.  We do have to ensure
neighbour tables don't grow too large, I expect we can do it in a way
that can scale from a small machine with few neighbours to a large
machine with many neighbours.

Perhaps the code just needs to limit the number of neighbours who have
never replied and the code is probing for an a per interface basis.

It still may make sense to have a global limit of perhaps a million
entries just because that would be an indicator that something has truly
gone weird.

Namespaces provide isolation at the level of names.  The objects still
share a kernel and compete for resources.  Not competing for resources
would require each namespace have it's own dedicated pool of resources
which over the whole machine would be much less efficient.

That is the fundamental design difference between namespaces and VM's
and it is why namespaces can be much cheaper and much more resource
efficient.  Reserving your worst case resource usage ahead of time tends
to result in a lot of inefficiencies.
