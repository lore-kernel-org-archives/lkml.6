Implementation? Device tree is hardware description.

I don't understand this sentence.

Device tree is _not_ documentation. And yes, it is normally pushed
together. But that did not happen here, and bindings are already in.

Bindings are an ABI between bootloader and kernel. They should not be
changed lightly.=20

Here I believe they should be fixed; not deleted.

Well -- I wanted to finish upstreaming. I still have those patches,
and they still look reasonably well. Better than=20

Bindings are authoritative. Of course, they can be fixed if really
neccessary, but normally code should be adapted to the bindings, not
the other way around.

If slow ramping up/down is something that would be expected in other
chips, too, ti, prefix is not good idea.

Yep, ok, so these should be fixed. Still the bindings should be fixed,
not removed and started over.

What about the multi function devices? They should have same binding.

The ti-lmu driver sounds like a way to go. We really want single
driver, even if more complex, than 6 separate ones.

Device bindings are operating systems independend. This is not an argument.

Perhaps location of the binding is wrong. Still not reason to drop it
and introduce new one.

You see? Even if your "new" binding has no flaws, "flawed" binding
still remains in tree, and we still have problems for lm3632, 3633,
3695. That's why it needs to be fixed, not replaced.
