Makes sense, it's sort of annoying to have to build the pdfs from
documentation repo and kup them to k.org manually.  In the meantime I'd
rather have a scribble-me-elmo wiki over a dead url.

Also afaik the only people who actually have write access to that wiki
are Luis, Eric, and me, so hopefully we won't have to deal with
vandalism in the interim.

I wonder if we could just make the existing dokiwiki use
xfs-documentation.git as its backend and control the publishing that
way...?
