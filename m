Ok, thanks for the explanation. Perhaps we can change the SDIO code so that it
uses NAPI in the future.

It came from mt76_txq_schedule():

if (hwq->swq_queued >= 4 || list_empty(&hwq->swq))
	break;

len = mt76_txq_schedule_list(dev, hwq);

Since this used a break, I simply inverted the logic,
and called ath10k_mac_tx_push_pending() rather than
mt76_txq_schedule_list().

However, I've submitted a V4 now that mimics the behavior
in ath10k_htt_txrx_compl_task() instead, so now I call
ath10k_mac_tx_push_pending() regardless of num_pending_tx.

In most cases, ath10k_mac_tx_push_pending() will not dequeue
any frames, since the ar->txqs list will be empty, so this
shouldn't be so bad after all.

It seems to be called by mac80211 in certain scenarios, but like you said,
it doesn't help with this problem.
