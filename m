Maybe it's me who misunderstand Daniel's words. But my understanding is
that riscv people are on a debate about whether their "RCpc" atomic
instructions need to be more strict: release+acquire pair orders two
writes. And I thought that atomics(including RmW atomics) in kernel only
have purely RCpc semantics, which I needed to check with you guy. And if
I'm right, it's cerntainly fine for riscv "RCpc" instruction to be
purely RCpc.

Note that even on PPC, the release+acquire pair of atomics orders writes
before and after, and on x86, writes are ordered since it's TSO. So
strictly speaking, I think our current implementation of atomics are a
little more strict than purely RCpc. If we think this is an requirement
for implementation of atomic primitives, than the current version of
riscv's "RCpc" atomics don't suffice.
