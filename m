Yeah, having to autheticate to write the MBR is a real bummer. Theoretically
you could dd a the pw struct + the shador MBR into sysfs. But that's
a pretty disgusting hack just to use sysfs. The other method I thought of
was to authenticate via ioctl then write via sysfs. We already save the PW
in-kernel for unlocks, so perhaps we can re-use the save-for-unlock to
do shadow MBR writes via sysfs?

Re-using an already exposed ioctl for another purpose seems somewhat dangerous?
In the sense that what if the user wants to write the smbr but doesn't want to
unlock on suspends, or does not want their PW hanging around in the kernel.

Overall I think the ioctl is still the best path forward due to the authentication
problem. But am still willing to hear others opinions if they do have an idea.

I can say yes to the Ioctl, but we really need Jens and Christophs Okay on it.

I have some free time tomorrow to work on this, so let me goof with it tomorrow and
over the weekend and I'll see if there is a sane way to get sysfs to work.
