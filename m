That would be good. Note however the fine difference - the s390 usage
is a wrapped key.
Ours is a token for a key (a slot number really). Probably makes no
difference for any
practical sense, but I thought it is worth mentioning it.

I am all for the keyring approach. In fact, that was the way I wanted
to to go to introduce this feature
for cryptocell when I discovered that was already upstream code using
a different approach.

Any suggestion how this would work vis a vis the crypto API usage?

e.g. - have a parallel setkey variant added to crypto APi that takes a
kernel keyring object rather than actual key?


Thanks,
Gilad
