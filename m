Untrue - it can do some parsing of the DT and updating/appending
information from ATAGs.  However, all that should be coming from
a trusted environment, so I don't see much of a "trust" issue here.
(If the parent environment is not trusted, then the environment we're
running in is not trusted.)

I'm no expert with this, so I can't comment.  I build my kernels
with gcc 4.7.4, which I don't think supports this feature.
