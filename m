Pretty often. On each context switch of a Linux guest, for example. It
is almost as bad as if we were trapping all VM ops. Moving it to C is
definitely visible on something like hackbench (I remember something
like a 10-12% degradation on Seattle, but I'd need to rerun the tests to
give you something accurate). It is the whole GPR save/restore dance
that costs us a lot (31 registers for the guest, 12 for the host), plus
some the extra SError synchronization that doesn't come for free either.

I agree that the multiplication of "earlier than early" paths is
becoming annoying. Moving the FP/SIMD stuff to C would be less
problematic, as we have patches to move some of that to load/put, and
we'd only take the trap once per time slice (as opposed to once per
entry at the moment).

Here, we're trying hard to do exactly nothing, because each instruction
is just an extra overhead (we've already nuked the BP). I even
considered inserting that code as part of the per-CPU-type vectors (and
leave the rest of the KVM code alone), but it felt like a step too far.

Thanks,
