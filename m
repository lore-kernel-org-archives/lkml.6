No, it cannot. We block page faulting for the file (via a lock), tear down
page tables, free pages and blocks. Then we resume faults and return
SIGBUS (if the page ends up being after the new end of file in case of
truncate) or do new page fault and fresh block allocation (which can end
with SIGBUS if the filesystem cannot allocate new block to back the page).
