I know you are looking to have support for PowerPC. 

Isn't this a PowerPC problem? Why penalize other architectures?

Do you see anything wrong with the code itself?

I started this thread with the PowerPC develoeprs on your request.
"RFC on writel and writel_relaxed"

They are looking into adding the relaxed API support. Support can come
in later. Why block this change now?

benh@kernel.crashing.org:
"I've been wanting to implement the relaxed accessors for a while but
was battling with this to try to also better support WC, and due to
other commitments, this somewhat fell down the cracks."

I have seen four different responses on this thread. Since this is an
architecture change it will take a while to get the semantics right.
It won't happen in the new few days.
