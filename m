No worries, I split it out:

    powerpc/64s: Make reliable stacktrace dependency clearer
    
    Make the HAVE_RELIABLE_STACKTRACE Kconfig option depend on
    PPC_BOOK3S_64 for documentation purposes. Before this patch, it
    depended on PPC64 && CPU_LITTLE_ENDIAN and because CPU_LITTLE_ENDIAN
    implies PPC_BOOK3S_64, there's no functional change here.
