OK. I wonder what "AT+CMUT=0" on mdm6600 then does? If a voice
call is requested and mdm6600 only has one i2s output it seems
kind of unnecesary :)

OK. So could it be just an alsamixer on/off toggle then for
"Modem" or something similar?

There's a typo above, it should be just ATD123 where 123 is the
number.

I was just doing few test calls to robots. Payback time for all
the robocalls, you know! :)

And calling a person I can hear the other end but the mic is
not working. So maybe I need to tweak the alsamixer settings
too for mic?
