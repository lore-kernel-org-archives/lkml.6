(Playing devil's advocate...)

If the user selected _STRONG and it becomes unavailable later, it
seems to silently fall back on other options, even for oldnoconfig
(which just checks if there are any new symbols in the choice).

It would be possible to also check if the old user selection still
applies btw. I do that in Kconfiglib. It's arguable whether that
matches the intent of oldnoconfig.

If you switch to a compiler that provides less capability, it'll
silently forget the old user preference though.

Obviously much neater at least. :)

Oh... right. For allnoconfig, it would always pick the default, so if
the default is "on", it's bad there.

Even neater. Much easier to understand.

So there's just the caveat about possibly "forgetting" the user
preferences and automatically falling back on
CC_STACKPROTECTOR_REGULAR or CC_STACKPROTECTOR_NONE when the
environment changes, instead of erroring out.

When you have to think hard about cases where something might break,
it might be a sign that it's not a huge problem in practice, but I
can't really speak for the priorities here.

Cheers,
Ulf
