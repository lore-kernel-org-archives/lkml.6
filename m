I think my stance always has been that this call is not good at all
because once you call it you never really know if it is still true as
the device could have been removed right afterward.

So almost any code that relies on it is broken, there is no locking and
it can and will race and you will loose.

I think your patch suffers from this race:

Great, but what happens if I yank the device out right here?

> +	val = readl(addr);

This value could now be all FF, if the device is gone, so what did the
check above help with?

So why do the check above for "is disconnected"?  What does this buy us
here, just short-circuiting the readl()?

Why even check, what's wrong with always doing the write?

I understand the wish to make this easier, but I think the only way is
that the driver themselves should be checking on their reads.  And they
have to check on all reads, or at least on some subset of reads and be
able to handle 0xff for the other ones without going crazy.

I _think_ the xhci driver does this given that it is hot added/removed
all the time dynamically due to the way that modern laptops are made
where the bios adds/removed the xhci controller when a USB device is
added/removed.
