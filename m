You are making nonsensical excuses.

That patch doesn't prevent you from refactoring the kernel and eliminating 
GFP_NOIO in the long term. You can apply the patch and then continue 
working on GFP_NOIO refactoring as well as before.

It may sleep, but if it sleeps regularly, it slows down swapping (because 
the swapping code does mempool_alloc and mempool_alloc does __GFP_NORETRY 
allocation). And there were two INTENTIONAL sleeps with schedule_timeout. 
You removed one and left the other, claiming that __GFP_NORETRY allocation 
should sleep.

Why aren't you constructive and pick up pick up the CONFIG flag?

The testing people won't set it up. They install the "kernel-debug" 
package and run the tests in it.

If you introduce a hidden option that no one knows about, no one will use 
it.
