Right, and that's exactly what I mean by "we need to be real careful
with functionality like this".

To be honest, I really don't think I've even touched the surface
here.

e.g. Filesystems and storage can share logical and physical extents.
Which means that image files that share storage (e.g.  because they
are all cloned from the same master image and/or there's in-line
deduplication running on the storage) and can be directly accessed
by guests may very well be susceptible to detection of host side
deduplication and subsequent copy-on-write operations.

This really doesn't seem much different to me from the guest being
able to infer host side KSM page deduplication and COW operation in
the guest side page cache.  The only difference is that DAX is being
used to probe the host side page cache and storage rather than the
guest side.

IOWs, I suspect there's a world of pain waiting for us if we punch
huge holes through the virtual machine abstractions like this.

Improving performance is a laudible goal, but at what price?

Cheers,

Dave.
