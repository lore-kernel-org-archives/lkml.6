I still think we should have all built LSMs enabled by default, with
CONFIG_LSM_DISABLE available to turn stuff off. CONFIG_LSM_ORDER
declares their order, "lsm.order=" works as mentioned, and
"lsm.enable/disable=" make changes to what's enabled.

(This would be most like the v3 series, swapping CONFIG_LSM_ENABLE for
CONFIG_LSM_DISABLE.)

It gives us centralized ordering and centralized disabling. Distros
wanting specific LSMs are already building them, so _also_ adding them
to CONFIG_LSM_ENABLE seems redundant to me. Distros wanting all the
LSMs just want to declare the order of initialization, and maybe add
some to CONFIG_LSM_DISABLE some day, so they use CONFIG_LSM_ORDER.

I should also note that I don't want to leave CONFIG_DEFAULT_SECURITY
in, since it's just a way to disable all the other majors. I don't
like this because it will force LSMs to be disabled that don't need to
be once blob-sharing lands. The whole point of this series is to get
us away from fixed ordering and thinking about "major" vs "minor" and
towards "exclusive" or not, where we can continue to slowly chip away
at exclusivity without breaking anything.
