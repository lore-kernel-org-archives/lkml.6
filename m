Uh, you came across as upset and paranoid to me too. Chalk it up to email? :)

I personally don't care, I have no horse in this race. This particular patch
series wasn't my idea, Christoph wanted all these conversions done so
bioset_create() could be deleted. If you want us to hold off on the dm patch for
awhile until someone can get around to testing it or whatever (since I don't
have tests for everything I pushed) that would be perfectly fine by me.
