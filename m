Hi Nicolai,

Good, that makes a lot of sense.  I couldn't find any reference
explaining the contents of frame 0, only unwinding code here and there
(as in crash-utility) that stepped over it.

That was my initial theory, but then when I saw an ordinary scheduled
task with a similarly strange frame 0, I thought that _switch() might
have been doing something clever (or not).  But according your earlier
explanation, it would line up that these values may be inherited from
do_IRQ() or the like.

I'll kick off some builds tonight and try to get tests lined up
tomorrow.  Unfortunately these take a bit of time to run setup, schedule
and complete, so perhaps by next week.

This may be sufficient to avoid the condition, but if the contents of
frame 0 are truely uninitialized (not to be trusted), should the
unwinder be even looking at that frame (for STACK_FRAMES_REGS_MARKER),
aside from the LR and other stack size geometry sanity checks?

Yup, that's right, I had it backwards.

Thanks!
