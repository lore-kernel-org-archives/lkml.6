That is indeed a good way to reason about it.

What I couldn't convince myself of was whether having 2 levels at stage2
implied the entry level block mapping being of the same size as the
stage1 block mapping, but given your explanation above, I think that's
fine.

Depends on how the code ends up looking like I suppose, but the more
symmetry we can have between the approach for host PMD and host PUD and
host PTE mappings, the better.
