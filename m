Hi Waiman!

I've started looking at the possibility to move Android to use cgroups
v2 and the availability of the cpuset controller makes this even more
promising.

I'll try to give a run to this series on Android, meanwhile I have
some (hopefully not too much dummy) questions below.

Another quite important use-case for cpuset is Android, where they are
actively used to do both power-saving as well as performance tunings.
For example, depending on the status of an application, its threads
can be allowed to run on all available CPUS (e.g. foreground apps) or
be restricted only on few energy efficient CPUs (e.g. backgroud apps).

Since here we are at "rewriting" cpusets for v2, I think it's important
to keep this mobile world scenario into consideration.

For example, in this context, we are looking at the possibility to
update/tune cpuset.cpus with a relatively high rate, i.e. tens of
times per second. Not sure that's the same update rate usually
required for the large NUMA systems you cite above.  However, in this
case it's quite important to have really small overheads for these
operations.

Does that means that we can move tasks into a newly created group for
which we have not yet configured this value?
AFAIK, that's a different behavior wrt v1... and I like it better.

This also sounds interesting, does it means that we use the
cpuset.cpus mask to restrict online CPUs, whatever they are?

I'll have a better look at the code, but my understanding of v1 is
that we spent a lot of effort to keep task cpu-affinity masks aligned
with the cpuset in which they live, and we do something similar at each
HP event, which ultimately generates a lot of overheads in systems
where: you have many HP events and/or cpuset.cpus change quite
frequently.

I hope to find some better behavior in this series.

This looks similar to v1, isn't it?

Which means that by default we can attach tasks instead of only
processes, right?
