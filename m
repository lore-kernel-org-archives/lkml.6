James, I  summarized the masking and routing rules for SError to
confirm with you for the firmware first solution,

1. If the HCR_EL2.{AMO,TGE} is set, which means the SError should route to EL2,
When system happens SError and trap to EL3,   If EL3 find
HCR_EL2.{AMO,TGE} and SPSR_EL3.A are both set,
and find this SError come from EL2, it will not deliver an SError:
store the RAS error in the BERT and 'reboot'; but if
it find that this SError come from EL1 or EL0, it also need to deliver
an SError, right?


2. If the HCR_EL2.{AMO,TGE} is not set, which means the SError should
route to EL1,
When system happens SError and trap to EL3, If EL3 find
HCR_EL2.{AMO,TGE} and SPSR_EL3.A are both not set,
and find this SError come from EL1, it will not deliver an SError:
store the RAS error in the BERT and 'reboot'; but if
it find that this SError come from EL0, it also need to deliver an
SError, right?
