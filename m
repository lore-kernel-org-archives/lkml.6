Keith, it looks to me that this is going to fix the issue between two nvme driver
instances at hotplug time. This is the one we didn't cover in the first patch.

We can see the issue at driver load (so at boot) and the lock isn't taken by the
generic non-rescan code. Other calls to pci_enable_device_mem aren't protected 
neither (see Bjorns message).

What do you think about applying both for now until we have a generic fix in pci?
