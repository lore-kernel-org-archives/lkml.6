Can you attach a screenshot of the Windows 10 device manager info for
the wifi adapter to the bugzilla?  If you can get a raw hex dump of
its config space, that would be awesome.

Also attach a copy of your kernel .config file (typically in /boot/).

My only guess is that maybe the system keeps wifi completely powered
down and uses hotplug to add it when needed.  [1] mentions wifi being
on pcibus 1 under Windows.  Your lspci does show bridge 00:13.0
leading to bus 01, but Linux doesn't find any devices on bus 01.

Hotplug could be done via either acpiphp (ACPI mediated hotplug) or
pciehp (native PCIe hotplug).  Your dmesg shows you do have acpiphp.

I can't tell about pciehp (your .config will show that), but I think
pciehp will only claim bridges where SltCap contains HotPlug+, and
yours shows HotPlug-, so I don't think pciehp will do anything on your
system.

Even if the system does use hotplug, I don't know what mechanism the
OS would use to wake up the device, since we don't know it even
exists.  I guess there could be some magic switch accessible via USB.
But if that were the case, I'm sure Emmanuel would know about it.
