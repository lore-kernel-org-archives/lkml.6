Thanks for that reference!

I suspect figure 10-3 in sec 10.1.1 might also be relevant, although
it's buried in the ATS section.  It shows internal routing between
functions of a multifunction device.  That suggests that the functions
should be able to DMA to each other without those transactions ever
appearing on the link.

Popping way up the stack, my original point was that I'm trying to
remove restrictions on what devices can participate in peer-to-peer
DMA.  I think it's fairly clear that in conventional PCI, any devices
in the same PCI hierarchy, i.e., below the same host-to-PCI bridge,
should be able to DMA to each other.

The routing behavior of PCIe is supposed to be compatible with
conventional PCI, and I would argue that this effectively requires
multi-function PCIe devices to have the internal routing required to
avoid the route-to-self issue.
