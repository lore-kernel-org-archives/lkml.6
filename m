Can you please re-run and report the results for each patch on the
ramdisk setup? And, please, include the mkfs.xfs or xfs_info output
for the ramdisk filesystem so I can see /exactly/ how much
concurrency the filesystems are providing to the benchmark you are
running.

50GB is tiny for XFS. Personally, I've been using ~1PB
filesystems(*) for the performance testing I've been doing
recently...

Cheers,

Dave.

(*) Yes, petabytes. Sparse image files on really fast SSDs are a
wonderful thing.
