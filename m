Yes this makes sense. I didn't really have arches without huge page
migration in mind.

I do not follow. You are usually allocating new pages outside of the
offlined range. But the above change makes sense because it doesn't
really make sense to migrate pfn if it is backed by a non-migrateable
huge page. dissolve_free_huge_pages should then try to remove it
completely and the offlining fails if that is not possible.

Good question. It is not necessary right now because has_unmovable_pages
called earlier should take care of it. But I guess it will not hurt to
have it there as well for the clarity.

That being said. The patch makes sense to me.

I guess we should mark it for stable even though I am not sure how often
do we see CONFIG_ARCH_ENABLE_HUGEPAGE_MIGRATION=n
