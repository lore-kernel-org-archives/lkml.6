That thread seems to be worried about the object disappearing the
moment it's reference count reaches a target. That isn't the case with
the memmap / struct page objects for ZONE_DEVICE pages. I understand
wait_for_atomic_one() is broken in the general case, but as far as I
can see it works fine specifically for ZONE_DEVICE page busy tracking,
just not generic object lifetime.
