This is the block layer running out of resources. The sg driver is a
relatively thin shim and when it gets a "no can do" from the layers
below it, the driver has little option than to return said errno.

Not much the sg driver can do about that. The minor number the sg driver
uses and HCT are all arbitrary integers (with the L coming from the
storage device), but I agree the HCTL is more widely used. The
ioctl(<sg_fd>, SG_GET_SCSI_ID) fills a structure which includes HCTL. In
my sg v4 driver rewrite the L (LUN) has been tweaked to additionally
send back the 8 byte T10 LUN representation.

The lsscsi utility will show the relationship between HCTL and sg driver
device name with 'lsscsi -g'. It uses sysfs datamining.

In my sg v4 rewrite the sg_io_v4 interface can only be sent through
ioctl(SG_IO) [for sync usage] and ioctl(SG_IOSUBMIT) [for async usage].
So it can't be sent through write(2). SG_IOSUBMIT is new and uses the
_IOWR macro which encodes the expected length into the SG_IOSUBMIT value
and that is the size of sg_io_v4. So you can't send an arbitrary number of
sg_io_v4 objects through that ioctl directly. If need be, that can be
cured with another level of indirection (e.g. with a new flag the data-out
can be interpreted as an array sg_io_v4 objects).

That limit is gone in the sg v4 driver rewrite.

Done.

Well poll() certainly works (see sg3_utils beta rev 809 testing/sgs_dd.c and
testing/sgh_dd.c) and I can't see why epoll() won't work. These calls work
against the file descriptor and the sg driver keeps the same context around
sg device file descriptors as it has always done. [And that is the major
design flaw in the bsg driver: it doesn't keep proper file descriptor context.]

It is the security folks who don't like the sg inspired (there in lk 1.0.0
from 1992) write(2)/read(2) asynchronous interface. Also, ideally we need
two streams: one for metadata (e.g. commands and responses (status and sense
data)) and another for user data. Protection information could be a third
stream, between the other two. Jamming that all into one stream is a bit ugly.
