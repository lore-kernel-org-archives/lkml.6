I'll add benchmarks with Zstandard.

The crypto api exposes each algorithm only once with its default compression level.
Currently there is no switch/option/mechanism/code or something to switch thoose levels.
Of course I could benchmark the algorithms with multiple compression levels.
How many / Which compression levels would you like to see to be compared with each other?

The kernel is the only place where so many small pieces of data need to be compressed.
In user space nobody cares that the data is splitted into pages, and therefore compression usually applied to large datasets.

Not yet.

I could add CRYPTO_ALG_TYPE_COMPRESS_UNSTABLE as an alias for CRYPTO_ALG_TYPE_COMPRESS

The current version of the decompressor is fuzz-safe. I tested it with lots of data and made sure, that each possible branch in the code is executed multiple times in different combinations.

I will port my code to user space and use afl-fuzz to test it.
