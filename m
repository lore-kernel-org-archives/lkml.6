This would work, _prior upgrade. (This's not my call of course).

I do however want to iterate, looking again at the above commit:

 		'rb_dep (*smp_read_barrier_depends*) ||
-		'rcu_read_lock (*rcu_read_lock*)  ||
-		'rcu_read_unlock (*rcu_read_unlock*) ||
-		'sync (*synchronize_rcu*) ||
+		'rcu-lock (*rcu_read_lock*)  ||
+		'rcu-unlock (*rcu_read_unlock*) ||
+		'sync-rcu (*synchronize_rcu*) ||
 		'before_atomic (*smp_mb__before_atomic*) ||
 		'after_atomic (*smp_mb__after_atomic*) ||
 		'after_spinlock (*smp_mb__after_spinlock*)

The question arises: dash or underscore? This needs to be fixed.
