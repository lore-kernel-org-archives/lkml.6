There's no way this series can get accepted, since you've made the
mistake of basing it on something that won't apply to the block
tree for 4.21. I've outlined these rules before, but here they are
again:

1) Patches destined for the CURRENT kernel version should be
   against my for-linus branch. That means that right now, any
   patches that should to into 4.20 should be against that.

2) Patches destined for the NEXT kernel version should be against
   my for-x.y/block branch, where x.y is the next version. As of
   right now, patches for 4.21 should be against my for-4.21/bloc
   branch.

I'd encourage you to respin against that, particularly in this case
since we've both got a lot of churn, and also removal of various
items that you are patching here.
