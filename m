Hi Nicolai,

Yeah, I was sloppy with the description there. :)

Hmm, I suppose a callee could leave that stack-word untouched and then
make subsquent calls, which would be confusing for the unwinder.

I agree that this seems like the simplest way to clean up the exception
stack frame state.

Good point, there is a bunch of ip and trace entries bookkeeping that
shouldn't apply in this case.

I gave the following some very light testing (5.0.0-rc2 + Petr's atomic
patches as to include and run the selftests) ... if you want to take a
bigger hammer to refactor some of the sp/newsp code (perhaps it could be
incorporated into the for() loop itself), feel free to go for it.  You
could add something like this as a 2nd patch to the previously mentioned
STACK_FRAME_REGS_MARKER cleanup fix.

Thanks,

Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/livepatch: relax reliable stack tracer checks for
 first-frame

The bottom-most stack frame (the first to be unwound) may be largely
uninitialized, for the "Power Architecture 64-Bit ELF V2 ABI" only
requires its backchain pointer to be set.

The reliable stack tracer should be careful when verifying this frame:
skip checks on STACK_FRAME_LR_SAVE and STACK_FRAME_MARKER offsets that
may contain uninitialized residual data.
