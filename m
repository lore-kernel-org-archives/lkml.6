The comment was to your statement:
"Ideally, we'd want to use an NVME CMB buffer as p2p memory. This would
save an extra PCI transfer as the NVME card could just take the data
out of it's own memory. However, at this time, cards with CMB buffers
don't seem to be available."

Maybe its a left-over which confused me...

Anyways, my question still holds. If I rack several of these
nvme drives, ideally we would use _their_ cmbs for I/O that is
directed to these namespaces. This is why I was suggesting that
p2p_dev should live in nvmet_ns and not in nvmet_ctrl as a single
p2p_dev used by all namespaces.

nvmet_ns seems like a more natural place to host p2p_dev with
cmb in mind.

Wouldn't it all be simpler if the p2p_dev resolution would be private
to the namespace?

So is adding some all the namespaces in a subsystem must comply to
using p2p? Seems a little bit harsh if its not absolutely needed. Would
be nice to export a subsystems between two ports (on two HCAs, across
NUMA nodes) where the home node (primary path) would use p2p and
failover would use host memory...

Can you help me understand why this is absolutely not feasible?

I was arguing that the user might have intentionally wanted to use p2p
where possible but still expose other namespaces over host memory. For
this user, the messages are spam. I guess info/warn could also suffice
(assuming we allow it, if we fail it then no point of the debug level
discussion).

In my mind, I/O to this namespace would use host memory and be done
with it. I guess I still don't understand why this is not possible.

Fair enough. Just wandering.
