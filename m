Thanks.  That helped.

I finished with git bisect.  Here's the output:
84c8590646d5b35804bac60eb58b145839b5893e is the first bad commit
commit 84c8590646d5b35804bac60eb58b145839b5893e

    target: avoid accessing .bi_vcnt directly
    
    When the bio is full, bio_add_pc_page() will return zero,
    so use this information tell when the bio is full.
    
    Also replace access to .bi_vcnt for pr_debug() with bio_segments().

I did a diff between HEAD^ and HEAD and manually patched the file from
4.15.14.  It's not an exact revert.  I'm running it now and it's working.
I'll do a better test later on.  Here's the patch:

I really appreciate your time and assistance with this.
