From my understanding, arm64 use of kzalloc_node() was derived from the
x86 version. Maybe somebody familiar with behaviour on x86 can provide
input here.

Agreed.

The patch is not meant as a work around for uninitialised NUMA nodes. I
mention it in the commit log as the context where this was
discovered. It seems to cause conflation of the issue addressed by the
patch - I'll drop it in future postings.

The problem is that acpi_get_node() just maps the proximity domain to a
node id, without initialising the node pglist_data or setting up the
zonelists. This happens in the case when the proximity domain is not
present in the SRAT (proximity domain has no attached cpus or memory)
but first encountered as part of _PXM() method for a device.

One approach to solve this problem would be to create
acpi_get_online_node() which attempts to online a NUMA node if it isn't
already or at the least return NUMA_NO_NODE.

Another would be to have kzalloc_node() perform the checks for online
node and return error if not.

It's not clear what the preferred approach is.
