Yes it segfaults the same way as before, as it tell the expansion is bad.

I don't understand what you mean, that's not different from before, is it ?

Indeed, after writing you I looked at it once more and I think I ended 
up with something rather similar as what you are proposing here.
The complexity in v5 was because I left the get_user() in 
store_updates_sp(). By moving it up into bad_stack_expansion(), it looks 
better.
The main difference I see between your proposal and my v8 is that I do 
the up_read() in bad_stack_expansion(). Maybe that's not a good idea.

I'll release it in a few minutes, let me know what you think about it.

Christophe
