Please align this proper

Aside of that, it's not interesting where these structs are going to be
transferred today because that might change tomorrow. So something like
this:

 * struct irq_affinity_desc - Interrupt affinity descriptor

@mask: please. It's one cpumask per descriptor.

Again, that's the purpose today.

 * @flags:	Flags to convey complementary information

But see further down.

Please align the member names vertically with tabs

struct irq_affinity_desc {
	struct cpumask	masks;
	unsigned int	flags;
};

Why do you want to do that separate allocation here? Just let
irq_create_affinity_masks() allocate an array of affinity descriptors and
use that. There is no point in copying that stuff over and over. Setting
the flag field can be done in the existing function as well.

No magic constant's please for a flags field. You really want proper
constants for that, but I'd rather avoid the whole flags fiddling
completely. See below.

> +		}

Can you please change the function signature and fixup the callers, if
there are any of them? Copying this over and over is horrible.

Please don't check flags for being !=0. Once we add other information than
the managed/non-managed decision to the flag field, then this will fall
apart.

To avoid issues like that please use explicit bits in the structure instead
of the opaque flags field:

struct irq_affinity_desc {
	struct cpumask	masks;
	unsigned int	managed : 1;
};

So if we add new things later they will have an explicit name and there is
absolute no conflict with existing code.

If you need braces for the if then the else path wants them as well.

You can spare a lot of pointless churn by just keeping the 'affinity' name
and only changing the struct type. The compiler will catch all places which
need to be fixed and 'affinity' is generic enough to be used with the new
struct type as well. As Bjorn said, even 'masks' is fine.

Other than the things I pointed out, the whole thing starts to look
palatable. Please split it up in the way Bjorn suggested and avoid the
extra hoops and loops where possible.

Thanks,
