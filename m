I'll do that tomorrow.

OK

Well, depending on how many systems are affected by the issues fixed by
17c91487364f IMO.

Arguably, if the FADT says "NO_ASPM", then the platform should not need the
OS to initialize ASPM to work.  I guess a manual workaround (like an extra
kernel command line option or similar) should suffice in this particular
case.
