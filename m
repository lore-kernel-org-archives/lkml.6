Wouldn't "pci=nomsi" be sufficient for that sort of bringup
experimentation?  We don't need to be super specific in that
situation.

The reason I want to remove it is that the port driver
(drivers/pci/pcie/portdrv*) has become a rat's nest of switches and
special cases, and I'm trying to simplify it.  Things like
"pcie_hp=nomsi" are trivial individually, but collectively it's
getting unmanageable.
