Jens, I remember I explained the renaming story to you in lsfmm a bit:

1) the current naming of segment is actually wrong, since every segment
only stores one single-page vector

2) the most important part is that once multipage bvec is introduced,
if the old _segment naming is still kept, it can be very confusing,
especially no good name is left for the helpers of dealing with real
segment.

For the foo2() temporary change, that is only for avoiding tree-wide
change in one single tree, with this way, we can change sub-system one
by one, but if you think it is good to do tree-wide conversion in one
patch, I am fine to do it in next version.

OK, I will post out again once v4.19 is started.

Thanks,
