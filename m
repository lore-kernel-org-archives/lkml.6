Indeed it is, but I don't want to abandon people with hardware in hand
if we can make it work despite being broken. Perfection is the enemy of
good. :)

The function has always been a private interface. It is not available
for drivers to rely on.

The only thing we're trying to accomplish is not start a transaction
if software knows it will not succeed. There are certainly times when
a transaction will fail that software does not forsee, but we're not
suggesting the intent handles that either.
