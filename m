I think so: we already have task_pt_regs() which gives access to the real return 
registers on the kernel stack.

I think as long as we constify the pointer, we should pass in the real thing.

I think as a general principle all system call tables should point to the 
first-hop wrapper symbol name (i.e. __sys32_ia32_*() in this case), not to the 
generic symbol name - even though we could generate the former from the latter.

The more indirection in these tables, the harder to read they become I think.

I don't think there should be a symbol space overlap, that will only lead to 
confusion. The symbols can be _similar_, with a prefix, underscores or so, but 
they shouldn't match I think.

BTW., I'd like all these bits to go through the x86 tree.

What is the expected merge route of the generic preparatory bits?

Thanks,
