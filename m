Not really. Tracing might be a more efficient tool that random BUG_ONs.

Which is not surprising because that kicks the CPU out of idle and starts
the tick timer again.

Does this restart the watchdog timers as well?

So in theory the soft lockup watchdog hrtimer should be queued here.

So this was the last time when the CPU came out of idle:

>   .idle_exittime  : 17763110009176 nsecs

Here it went back into idle:

>   .idle_entrytime : 17763129999625 nsecs

And this was the next timer wheel timer due for expiry:

>   .idle_expires   : 17763130000000 nsecs

which makes no sense whatsoever, but this might be stale information. Can't
tell.

The tick timer is scheduled because the next timer wheel timer is due at
59552950000000, which might be the hard watchdog timer

That might be the soft lockup hrtimer.

I'd try to gather more information about the chain of events via tracing
and stop the tracer once the lockup detector hits.
