This is subtly wrong. There was some state that was encoded by having the
loop the way we did.

the tl;dr is the check needs to be if (error && state > 1) still.

The why is that in the previous implementation we wanted to end_opal_session_error
only if a successful discovery0 AND a successful start_*_session. In the previous loop,
discovery0 would complete, we'd do state++, then we'd go and attempt to start our
session. If we failed on that session starting we'd still be in state 1, and wouldn't
attempt to close the session.

In the current form, discovery0 is gone, so start session is on state 0. If we fail
on the start session, we set error = true, state gets ++'d, then we look at !error
and we don't loop again.

We go down to the check and attempt to end a session that was never started.
