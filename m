Suspend to RAM will be broken if the clock is suspended and no
notification will happen in the NOIRQ phase, it is a new-broken-feature.

I will merge this series when it works, I have no evidence that it does
given what you are writing above, if the series you mention are
*necessary* for suspend-to-RAM to work they ought to be merged first.
