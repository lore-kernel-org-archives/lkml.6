I compared with the mt2712 platform, which is an arm64 platform, and the
EP deivce is an Intel e1000e NIC. Compiled these drivers to modules
(without this patch applied both), and insert them separately after
system startup.

After insert these modules, there will be an Ethernet device on both
platform, and the 64-bit platform works properly, but the 32-bit
platform doesn't.

1.The following logs is from the 64-bit platform (mt2712):
