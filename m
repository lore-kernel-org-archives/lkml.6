This is exactly my point: we don't want to have to wait for somebody
to report an issue for every new GPU.  That (a) is a maintenance
headache and, more importantly, (b) prevents an old kernel from
running on new hardware.  (b) is important to distros because nobody
wants to qualify and release a new kernel just to add a new device ID.

Bottom line is that I think I'm going to have to apply this patch, but
I want to get off this train in the future, so now is the time to find
a better solution.

If you could test this, that would be great.  I would be quite
surprised if Windows crashed when you unplug the VGA cable.

What I'm wondering is if there's some different way we could manage
the IOAPICs or maybe disable interrupts at the PCI device level as
David suggests.  If something like that could be done we wouldn't need
quirks for every new device.

It's possible we could learn something by running Windows on qemu and
tracing its PCI config accesses to see whether it sets the
PCI_COMMAND_INTX_DISABLE bit or something.
