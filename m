Ok, I will do an overall check to fix the entries.

I will add more information about it.

That's true, it should exist some explanation of that. To be honest I didn't
remember of the pci-test-howto.txt file existence.

This type of configuration / configuration was suggested by Kishon. I can only
assume that it would not be possible (or no one thought of it) to correlate the
compatible string of the controller to select the configuration, perhaps Kishon
could give his opinion on the feasibility of this and even to provide some
example of it. :)

If it is possible, it will be quite straightforward.
