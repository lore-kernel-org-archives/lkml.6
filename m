Hi Andy,

In general I'm not a big fan of arbitrary API shortcuts. I won't object
if you think it's a good one to have, however I'm a bit concerned about
the silent handling of the "error case", which could cause unexpected
default decisions as seen in patch 2/4 of this series. The fact that
dmi_get_bios_year() returns 0 if there is no DMI BIOS date provided
should at least be documented, to limit the risk.

I also wonder if dmi_get_date() itself couldn't be optimized a bit if
it turns out that most callers are only interested in the year.
Currently it will parse the whole string even if the caller isn't
interested in the month and day.

The fact that dmi_get_date() returns true even if it couldn't parse the
date string at all is also strange, although unrelated with your
current work.

checkpatch complains:

WARNING: Missing a blank line after declarations
#61: FILE: include/linux/dmi.h:153:
+	int year;
+	dmi_get_date(DMI_BIOS_DATE, &year, NULL, NULL);

And I would tend to agree. Just because it is an inline function in a
header file doesn't mean we don't stick to the usual coding style
policy.
