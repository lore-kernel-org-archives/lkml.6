The patch which Paul plans to send in for the next merge window makes 
the LKMM require RCtso ordering for spinlocks, and by extension, for 
all locking operations.  As I understand it, the current RISC-V 
implementation of spinlocks does provide this ordering.

We have discussed creating another patch for the LKMM which would
require RMW-acquire/ordinary-release also to have RCtso ordering.  
Nobody has written the patch yet, but it would be straightfoward.  The
rationale is that many types of locks are implemented in terms of
RMW-acquire, so if the locks are required to be RCtso then so should
the lower-level operations they are built from.

Will feels strongly (and Linus agrees) that the LKMM should not require
ordinary acquire and release to be any stronger than RCpc.

The issue that Andrea raised has to do with qspinlock, qrwlock, and
mcs_spinlock, which are implemented using smp_cond_load_acquire()  
instead of RMW-acquire.  This provides only the ordering properties of
smp_load_acquire(), namely RCpc, which means that qspinlocks etc. might
not be RCtso.

Since we do want locks to be RCtso, the question is how to resolve this 
discrepancy.

On all other architectures, as far as I know, smp_cond_load_acquire() 
is in fact RCtso.  Any changes would only be needed on RISC-V.

A quick grep of the kernel source (not quite up-to-date, unfortunately)  
turns up only the following additional usages of 
smp_cond_load_acquire():

	It is used in kernel/smp.c for csd_lock(); I don't know what 
	that is meant for.

	It is also used in the scheduler core (kernel/sched/core.c).  I 
	don't know what ordering requirements the scheduler has for it,
	but Peter does.

	There's a usage in drivers/iommu/arm-smmu-v3.c, but no comment 
	to explain why it is needed.

To tell the truth, I'm not aware of any code in the kernel that
actually _needs_ RCtso ordering for locks, but Peter and Will are quite
firm that it should be required.  Linus would actually like locks to be
RCsc, but he recognizes that this would incur a noticeable performance
penalty on Power so he'll settle for RCtso.

I'm not in a position to say whether smp_cond_load_acquire() should be 
changed, but hopefully this information will help others to make that 
determination.
