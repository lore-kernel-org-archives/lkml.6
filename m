IIUC, Andrea described this problem: certain processes in a certain =
group dirty a
lot of pages, causing write back to start.  Then some other blameless
process in the same group experiences very high latency, in spite of
the fact that it has to do little I/O.

Does your blk_cgroup_congested() stuff solves this issue?

Or simply I didn't get what Andrea meant at all :)

Thanks,
Paolo
