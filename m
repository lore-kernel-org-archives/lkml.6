Ah, I wasn't aware of that. We definitely shouldn't let userspace change
key 0 permissions then. :-) It would be good to have this information in
a comment in the code somewhere, IMHO.

Yes, now I see how the allocated-but-not-enabled state makes sense.
Considering that the kernel always uses key 0, it's unworkable on
powerpc for an app to free pkey 0. In that case I think we should reject
it in mm_pkey_free().

I think this would be a good place to explain why we can't allow
userspace to change permissions on key 0.

Indeed. Thanks for explaining and even double-checking that it's indeed
the case.

It doesn't hurt, but it's redundant since the is_pkey_enabled() call
right below will have the same effect.

Actually I just changed my mind because I see now that the early exit
prevents the need to read the UAMOR (which is done by
is_pkey_enabled()). Since this function is called by page table code
it's probably worth avoiding the additional SPR access.
