Even network filesystems are going to have challenges of filesystems
being visible in some network namespaces and not others.  As some
filesystems will be visible on the internet and some filesystems will
only be visible on the appropriate local network.  Network namespaces
are sometimes used to deal with the case of local networks with
overlapping ip addresses.

I think you are proposing a model for network filesystems that is
essentially the same situation where we are with most block devices
filesystems today.  Where some parameters identitify the local
filesystem instance and some parameters identify how the kernel
interacts with that filesystem instance.


For system efficiency there is a strong argument for having the fewest
number of filesystem instances we can.  Otherwise we will be caching the
same data twice and wasting space in RAM etc.


So I like the idea.


At least for devpts we always create a new filesystem instance every
time mount(2) is called.  NFS seems to have the option to create a new
filesystem instance every time mount(2) is called as well, (even if the
filesystem parameters are the same).  And depending on the case I can
see the attraction for other filesystems as well.

So I don't think we can completely abandon the option for filesystems
to always create a new filesystem instance when mount(8) is called.



I most definitely support thinking this through and figuring out how it
best make sense for the new filesystem API to create new filesystem
instances or fail to create new filesystems instances.
