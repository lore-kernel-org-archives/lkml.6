The reason is that it has not been yet in focus in the review process
and there has been other concerns.

At least the code is fairly stable i.e. working code is usually good
starting point for making something different (ignoring the recent
regression caused by the shmem to VMA migration).

The current SGX_IOC_ENCLAVE_CREATE ioctl would be trivial to change to
use this approach. Instead looking up VMA with an enclave instance it
would create a new enclave instance.

Then we could have SGX_IOC_ENCLAVE_ATTACH to attach an enclave to a VMA.

This does not sound too complicated.

We do EADD in a kthread. What this would require to put current->mm
into a request that it is processed by that thread. This would be
doable with mmget().

The deadlock that Sean mentioned would not exist since closing VMAs
is not bounded to the enclave life-cycle anymore.

So at least non-swapping ISA is easy to fit to this framework. I can
rework this for v19.
