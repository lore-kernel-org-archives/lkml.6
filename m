Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: fpga: Consolidate bridge properties
Date: Wed, 21 Feb 2018 09:33:06 -0800
Message-Id: <20180221173306.17265-1-mdf@kernel.org>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.16.1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Consolidate bridge properties in a single file, instead of duplicating
the same optional property over and over again.
