My aim was to change as little as possible for everybody else while
fixing our problem. These changes are already controversial enough
without risky reusing of existing fields in common structures. I was
just afraid that there are too many intricacies for it to be safe.

This is something that the previous implementation did. It was quite
unreadable, so I decided to go with a separate list.

This would extend the structure for everybody else while there'll be
very few such devices and not all systems would even require it.

I thought about it, but I was afraid there could be some timing issues
with that and decided against it. The early deferral also doesn't work
in a workque, but is synchronous instead.
