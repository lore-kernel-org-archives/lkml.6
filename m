At this point, any reader who saw the element in the list is done, as you
comment in fact says.  But there might be a pointer to that element in the
per-CPU variables, however, from this point forward it cannot be the case
that one of the per-CPU variables gets set to the newly deleted element.
Which is your next block of code...

... Someone else might have picked up rcu_conn at this point...

... But if there was any possibility of that, need_to_wait is true, and it
still cannot be the case that a reader finds the newly deleted element
in the list, so they cannot find that element, so the pcpu_rcu_conn
variables cannot be set to it.

And at this point, the reader that might have picked up rcu_conn
just before the cmpxchg must have completed.  (Good show, by the way!
Many people miss the fact that they need this second synchronize_rcu().)

Hmmm...  What happens if this was the last element in the list, and
the relevant pcpu_rcu_conn variable references that newly removed
element?  Taking a look at list_next_or_null_rcu() and thus at
list_next_or_null_rcu(), and it does appear that you get NULL in that
case, as is right and good.

At first glance, it appears that you have handled this correctly.  But I
can make mistakes just as easily as the next guy, so what have you done
to validate your algorithm?
