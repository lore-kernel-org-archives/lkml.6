I may not be understanding the concern, but I'll give it a shot.

You're right, the start of any SQE is always 64-byte aligned, so that
should satisfy alignment requirements.

The order when writing multiple/successive SQEs in a submission queue
does matter, and this is currently serialized through the q_lock.

The order in which the bytes of a single SQE is written doesn't really
matter as long as the entire SQE is written into the CMB prior to writing
that SQ's doorbell register.

The doorbell register is written immediately after copying a command
entry into the submission queue (ignore "shadow buffer" features),
so the doorbells written to commands submitted is 1:1.

If a CMB SQE and DB order is not enforced with the memcpy, then we do
need a barrier after the SQE's memcpy and before the doorbell's writel.
