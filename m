I don't think that's right.  What would make the IPIs "simultaneous"  
would be if none of the handlers return until all of them have started
executing.  For example, you could have each handler increment a shared
variable and then spin, waiting for the variable to reach the number of
CPUs, before returning.

What you wrote was to have each handler wait until all the IPIs had 
been sent, which is not the same thing at all.

Yes.

Do you really want to put sys_membarrier into the LKMM?  I'm not so 
sure it's appropriate.
