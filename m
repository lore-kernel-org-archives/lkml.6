percpu variable may waste space too if the possible cpu number is
provided not accurately from ACPI.

There are also IBM s390, in which physical CPU hotplug is one normal use
case.

Looks not see any other solution posted out for virt, and it may cause
complicated queue dependency issue by re-introducing CPU hotplug
handler for blk-mq.

Given this patchset doesn't have effect on normal machines without
supporting physical CPU hotplug, it can fix performance regression on
machines which might support physical CPU hotplug(cpu_present_mask !=
cpu_possible_mask) with some extra memory allocation cost.

So is there any chance to make it in v4.17?

Thanks,
Ming
