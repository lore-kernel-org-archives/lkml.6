No, there would be no need to change anything for boxes already in the
field.  But for *new* systems, you could make devices or thermal zones
in the ACPI namespace (they might even already be there for use by
Windows).

drivers/thermal/int340x_thermal/processor_thermal_device.c claims
either INT3401 ACPI devices or listed PCI devices.  It looks like it
tries the platform (INT3401) devices first, and if it finds any, it
ignores any matching PCI devices.  This *could* be so it uses INT3401
devices on new platforms and falls back to the PCI devices otherwise,
although there *are* recent updates that add PCI IDs.

It looks like INT3401 is Intel-specific since it uses a PPCC method
which isn't defined by the ACPI spec.  But AMD could define a similar
PNP ID and have new platforms expose ACPI devices with _TMP methods
that know how to read the sensor on that platform.

Or maybe even drivers/acpi/thermal.c, which claims every Thermal Zone
(ACPI 6.2, sec 11), would be sufficient.  I don't know what the
relationship between hwmon and other thermal stuff, e.g.,
Documentation/thermal/sysfs-api.txt is.  acpi/thermal.c looks tied
into the drivers/thermal stuff (it registers "thermal_zone" devices),
but not to hwmon.

As long as we have a driver that knows how to claim a known PNP ID,
and every new platform exposes a device compatible with that ID, the
driver should just work.
