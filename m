Even if virtio-balloon is sufficient from a performance perspective, the
virtio-mem approach can provide unique capabilities, e.g. hotplugging
EPC into a VM or "I'm done with SGX, have all of my EPC back".

It's not a KVM requirement, but rather Qemu's code flow.  It sets up the
"machine" and then creates the vCPUs.  The CPUID info is a CPU capability
and so isn't necessarily available when the "machine" is being created.

It's not that it can't be done, but rather we'd have to explicitly tell
KVM "this private slot isn't really private, expose it to L2".  See
commit 3a2936dedd20 ("kvm: mmu: Don't expose private memslots to L2").
