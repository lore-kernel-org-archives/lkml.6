Are these writes from userspace or from the guest?
(I assume they're from the guest.)

Was this previous experiment using my patch or without my patch?

If the guest you're using is flipping the group of the interrupt and yet
enabling the device and interrupt while flipping the group, then it's
not expected to work and it's a guest bug.

My hunch here tells me that my patch is what we need for KVM, and either

  (1) You no longer have a problem but are tracing some guest
      initialization behavior which is fine, or

  (2) You still have a problem because you also have some broken guest
      code (guest UEFI or guest Linux) that also needs fixing.

If you can demonstrate that you still have a problem, with my path
applied to KVM, and with a recent guest Linux and guest UEFI, then I'll
be happy to have another look.  In that case, could you please provide
the exact versions of your guest Linux and UEFI, as well as the QEMU
version and command line.


Thanks,
