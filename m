pgtable_page_ctor() acts on a given page used as page table at any level
which sets appropriate page type (page flag PG_table) and increments the
zone stat for NR_PAGETABLE. pgtable_page_dtor() exactly does the inverse.

These two complimentary operations are required for every level page table
pages for their proper initialization, identification in buddy and zone
statistics. Hence these need to be called for all level page table pages.

pgtable_pmd_page_ctor()/pgtable_pmd_page_dtor() on the other hand just
init/free page table lock on the page for !THP cases and additionally
init page->pmd_huge_pte (deposited page table page) for THP cases.
Some archs seem to be calling pgtable_pmd_page_ctor() in place of
pgtable_page_ctor(). Wondering would not that approach skip page flag
and accounting requirements.

At present on arm64 certain kernel page table page allocations call
pgtable_pmd_page_ctor() and some dont. The series which I had posted
make sure that all kernel and user page table page allocations go through
pgtable_page_ctor()/dtor(). These constructs are required for kernel
page table pages as well for accurate init and accounting not just for
user space. The series just skips vmemmap struct page mapping from this
as that would require generic sparse vmemmap allocation/free functions
which I believe should also be changed going forward as well.

No. Instead we should just make sure the that those pages go through
dtor() destructor path when getting freed and the clean up series
does that.
