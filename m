Seems I should have saved some of the things I said in my previous
response for this one. As you no doubt gleaned from that email, I agree
with this.

I'm missing how we figure out the target user ns in this scheme. We need
a context with privileges towards the source path's s_user_ns to say
it's okay to shift ids for the files under the source path, and then we
need a target user ns for the id shifts. Currently the target is
current_user_ns when the final shiftfs mount is created.

So, how do we determine the target s_user_ns in your scheme?

Yeah, I noticed that too. I left it in for the moment to emphasize the
change I was making, but it can be removed.

Summarizing my response to the other message, if the mark mount is kept
(and I would prefer that it isn't kept) that seems reasonable to me.

Thanks,
