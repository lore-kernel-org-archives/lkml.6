Fair enough.   But to do that correctly I think we will need to convert
get_user_pages_fast() to use flags as well.  I have a version of this series
which includes a patch does this, but the patch touched a lot of subsystems and
a couple of different architectures...[1]

I can't test them all.  If we want to go that way I'm up for submitting the
patch...  But if we remove longterm in the future we may be left with a
get_user_pages_fast() which really only needs 1 flag.  But perhaps overall we
would be better off?

[1] mm/gup.c: Change GUP fast to use flags rather than write bool

To facilitate additional options to get_user_pages_fast change the
singular write parameter to be the more generic gup_flags.

This patch currently does not change any functionality.  New
functionality will follow in subsequent patches.

Many of the get_user_pages_fast call sites were unchanged because they
already used FOLL_WRITE or 0 as appropriate.
