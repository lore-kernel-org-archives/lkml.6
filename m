Hi Tejun, Lia, all,

While doing some unrelated testing earlier, I found a bug in workqueue
lockdep, and while looking into the code I found another bug, and another
limitation. I'll follow up with patches for the two bugs, and explain all
three issues here.


1)
Lockdep report is below - the problem is the following: cancel_work_sync()
calls flush_work(), which may or may not do something, depending on whether
or not it's running. This is reasonable for semantics of the workqueue, but
it's not fine for lockdep, and also the reason for issue 3 below.

The lockdep report I hit basically says:
 * you're flushing (but really I'm doing cancel_work_sync) the work
   item, so we take the workqueue lockdep map (it's an ordered
   workqueue)
 * the workqueue has other work items that can be on it, that take locks
   that we already hold (at least indirectly via a dependency chain)
 * thus a locking violation occurred - the other work might be pending
   or running, so you have to wait for it and get a deadlock

Note how this isn't true - we really call cancel_work_sync(), so we don't
need to wait for any other work to run. If this one's running, it must be
the first one running on the workqueue (otherwise we'd just have cancelled
it and it wouldn't be running). Thus, the code is fine, but because
cancel_work_sync() just uses flush_work(), the annotation isn't quite
right. I've fixed that in the follow-up patch by making the annotation
depend on where we came from, but I'm not entirely sure that's the right
thing to do.

2)
The second issue is that we never really use work->lockdep_map when we
flush the work, and thus if we have code like

work_function
{
	mutex_lock(&mutex);
}

other_function
{
	mutex_lock(&mutex);
	flush_work(&work);
}

we never actually get a lockdep report. I've fixed this by putting a lock
map acquire/release in the (hopefully) correct place.

3)
The third problem is more complicated, but it means that we likely miss a
lot of potential locking problems with ordered workqueues, and I think we
should really try to fix this somehow.

Let's say we again have an ordered workqueue, and the following:

work1_function
{
	mutex_lock(&mutex);
}

work2_function
{
	// empty
}

other_function
{
	queue_work_on(&ordered_wq, &work1);
	queue_work_on(&ordered_wq, &work2);
	flush_workqueue(&ordered_wq);
	mutex_lock(&mutex);
	flush_work(&work2);
}

As far as I can tell, this will not generate a lockdep report, because the
flush_work() will not find any pwq in start_flush_work(), and thus will do
"goto already_gone" without ever doing anything with lockdep. After my
second patch, at least it will still acquire and release the
work2.lockdep_map, but that doesn't create any dependency with the whole
workqueue.

I realize that this is difficult since the work struct isn't tied to the
workqueue while it's not running, and it could possibly be used with
different workqueues, but I think we need to solve this too, somehow.

Perhaps we can give each work struct *two* lockdep maps? One that includes
the workqueue dependency, and one that doesn't? Then we could create a
dependency when scheduling:

  schedule_work_on():
    lock_map_acquire(work->wq_lockdep_map);
    lock_map_acquire(wq->lockdep_map);

and then in flush we take both:
    lock_map_acquire(work->lockdep_map);
    lock_map_acquire(work->wq_lockdep_map);

(perhaps also when running the work).

Then, the above scenario should create the following relevant lockdep chain:

mutex			--> work2->wq_lockdep_map
work2->wq_lockdep_map	--> wq->lockdep_map
wq->lockdep_map		--> work->wq_lockdep_map
work->wq_lockdep_map	--> mutex

I think?
