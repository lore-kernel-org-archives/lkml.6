So we have decades of filesystem design based on one threat model, and
some desktop environments decided to blow it all up 'cause it's more
convenient that way.

Super.  Maybe the email client can start auto-running attachments, too,
For The Convenience.

What's the phrase... poor planning on your part doesn't constitute an
emergency on my part?  :/  (not actually referring to /you/, Ted) ;)

Anyway, if desktops auto-mounting USB sticks is the primary threat,
maybe time would be better spent adding restrictions there - allow only a
subset of common USB formats which are simple and have been fuzzed to hell
and back, rather than mounting whatever you happened to find lying in the
parking lot at work and hoping that somebody, somewhere, has discovered and
fixed every attack vector now that we've blown up the trust model
For The Convenience.

(Digging through dconf-editor, there's just on/off, no gui method at
least, to include or exclude automountable fs types.  It's all or
nothing.  TBH I have no idea how many mechanisms are out there to do
this automounting - hal/udev/systemd/ghome/dbus/...?)

Anyway, fuzzers aside, it sure seems like if we can't un-ring the
automount bell, it'd be prudent to limit it to FAT by default and focus
efforts on making that as safe as possible.

Even after you apply AC mains to the USB port?  Cool, Chrome's pretty
resilient.  ;)

I think Dave may have been just stating a reality there rather than agreeing
with it, not sure.

For sure.  I guess some subset of the crashes could be more carefully
crafted to be more dangerous, but fuzzers really don't tell us that today,
in fact the more insidious flaws that don't turn up as a crash or hang likely
go unnoticed.
