This is a pointer to the earlier discussion
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20180409125818.GE10904@cbox/.
It seems there is some agreement reached to flip ptrauth status in
every vcpu load/unload
as this would cater to both ptrauth enabled/disabled application.

Yes it can be done. Currently it is done indirectly by userspace
option. Agree with you on this.

Yes it may be possible and generic ptrauth userspace patches by
Kristina has a separate
check for generic key. I will add a similar check here.

Save and restore of key possible in C function with GCC function attribute like
sign-return-address=none. I left the switch function as of now and
only this change is needed
to enable it for kernel ptrauth.

Since vcpu is a thread so keys are allocated using the current user
ptrauth patches and
I can see in guest switch that has keys are present in guest context.
Do you see advantage
in allocating keys in the above way?

yes reusing will be better.

I think it was decided to enable all features even though they are not
