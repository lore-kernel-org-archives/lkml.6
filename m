I like the idea in general, and it might be good to note (e.g., commit
message) that this was inspired by this thread:

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20180815221601.GB24830@rob-hp-laptop/

where we were interested in firmware-to-device-tree path stability --
and the answer was basically: don't memorize paths, just use aliases
instead. But then, it was clear that aliases were not documented very
formally at all.

So here we are!

For the network-device-related names (bluetooth, ethernet, and wifi), I
think there's a clear documented reason for this (supporting MAC address
plumbing from a DT-aware bootloader). I'm not quite as sure about all
the others, and unfortunately, I'm aware of at least one subsystem owner
that explicitly does NOT like the aliases usage that is currently
supported (spi), and shot down a patch where I tried to use it in a DTS
file (despite its regular usage in many other DTS files).

So I guess I'm saying: perhaps we should get buy-in from various
subsystems before we include them? So maybe it's wiser to start
small(er) and only add once we're sure they are useful? Or perhaps Rob
has other thoughts.

What is the relevance of this line? This doesn't look anything like that
hikey DTS. Maybe the "based on" line should just be removed? The example
seems fine though.

Anyway, perhaps with a trimmed list of supported alias names:
