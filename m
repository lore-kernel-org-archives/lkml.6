I _really_ would like to see this land for 4.18.  It'll avoid downstream
backport problems (due to all the churn in this patchset).

As I'm sure you've seen I reviewed and Acked-by the DM patch.

I mentioned I've been chatting with Kent, he is available if anything
needs a v2 for whatever reason.

Would you be OK adding a single sentence description to each driver's
patch header (rather than leaving empty like how Kent submitted)?  Or
should Kent resubmit the entire set with that boilerplate header for
each patch?
