Now that the LRU lock is a RW lock, lay the groundwork for fine-grained
synchronization so that multiple threads holding the lock as reader can
safely remove pages from an LRU at the same time.

Add a thread-safe variant of list_del called smp_list_del that allows
multiple threads to delete nodes from a list, and wrap this new list API
in smp_del_page_from_lru to get the LRU statistics updates right.

For bisectability's sake, call the new function only when holding
lru_lock as writer.  In the next patch, switch to taking it as reader.

The algorithm is explained in detail in the comments.  Yosef Lev
conceived of the algorithm, and this patch is heavily based on an
earlier version from him.  Thanks to Dave Dice for suggesting the
prefetch.
