This v2 version works for me as tested with:

# while [ 1 ]; do ifconfig wlan0 down; ifconfig wlan0 up; done
[  181.364990] wlcore: down
[  182.116424] wlcore: firmware booted (Rev 6.3.10.0.141)
[  182.151641] IPv6: ADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): wlan0: link is not ready
[  182.166778] wlcore: down
[  182.773132] wlcore: firmware booted (Rev 6.3.10.0.141)
[  182.811096] IPv6: ADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): wlan0: link is not ready
...

Thanks for fixing this issue properly, and feel free to add:
