You are right so far.  Now suppose one of the sequence points is an
"if" statement:

	foo();		// sequence point
	*a = 1;
	if (*b)		// sequence point
		*c = 2;
	*d = 3;
	boo();		// sequence point

The object code has to behave _as though_ the write to *a was completed 
before the write to *d begins, because of the sequence point in 
between.  But nevertheless, the object code is allowed to be like this:

	foo();
	*d = 3;
	*a = 1;
	if (*b)
		*c = 2;
	boo();

because the overall effect is the same, if all you are concerned with
is this single thread.  (And assuming that none of the pointers alias
each other.)

The compiler must not move the "*d = 3" write up before the call to
foo(), because foo() might read the value of *d and then it would get
an incorrect answer.  Moving the write before the "if" statement and
the assignment to *a is okay, however, because those statements would
do the same thing no matter what value was stored in *d.
