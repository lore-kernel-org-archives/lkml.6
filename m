The recent commit adding support for SRCU to the Linux Kernel Memory
Model ended up changing the names and meanings of several relations.
This patch updates the explanation.txt documentation file to reflect
those changes.

It also revises the statement of the RCU Guarantee to a more accurate
form, and it adds a short paragraph mentioning the new support for SRCU.

+	that this relation is "inverted": It links the end of the
+	critical section to the start.)
 
 If we think of the rcu-link relation as standing for an extended
-"before", then X ->gp Y ->rcu-link Z says that X executes before a
-grace period which ends before Z executes.  (In fact it covers more
-than this, because it also includes cases where X executes before a
-grace period and some store propagates to Z's CPU before Z executes
-but doesn't propagate to some other CPU until after the grace period
-ends.)  Similarly, X ->rscs Y ->rcu-link Z says that X is part of (or
-before the start of) a critical section which starts before Z
-executes.

-The LKMM goes on to define the rcu-fence relation as a sequence of gp
-and rscs links separated by rcu-link links, in which the number of gp

+"before", then X ->rcu-gp Y ->rcu-link Z roughly says that X is a
+grace period which ends before Z begins.  (In fact it covers more than
+this, because it also includes cases where some store propagates to
+Z's CPU before Z begins but doesn't propagate to some other CPU until

-	X ->gp Y ->rcu-link Z ->rscs T ->rcu-link U ->gp V

+	X ->rcu-rscsi Y ->rcu-link Z ->rcu-rscsi T ->rcu-link U ->rcu-gp V
 
 does not imply X ->rcu-fence V, because the sequence contains only
-one gp link but two rscs links.
+one rcu-gp link but two rcu-rscsi links.
 
 The rcu-fence relation is important because the Grace Period Guarantee
 means that rcu-fence acts kind of like a strong fence.  In particular,
-if W is a write and we have W ->rcu-fence Z, the Guarantee says that W
-will propagate to every CPU before Z executes.
+E ->rcu-fence F implies not only that E begins before F ends, but also
+that any write po-before E will propagate to every CPU before any
+instruction po-after F can execute.  (However, it does not imply that
+E must execute before F; in fact, each synchronize_rcu() fence event
+is linked to itself by rcu-fence as a degenerate case.)
 
 To prove this in full generality requires some intellectual effort.
 We'll consider just a very simple case:
 
-	W ->gp X ->rcu-link Y ->rscs Z.
+	G ->rcu-gp W ->rcu-link Z ->rcu-rscsi F.
 
-This formula means that there is a grace period G and a critical
-section C such that:
+This formula means that G and W are the same event (a grace period),
+and there are events X, Y and a read-side critical section C such that:
 
-	1. W is po-before G;
+	1. G = W is po-before or equal to X;
 
-	2. X is equal to or po-after G;
+	2. X comes "before" Y in some sense (including rfe, co and fr);
 
-	3. X comes "before" Y in some sense;
+	2. Y is po-before Z;
 
-	4. Y is po-before the end of C;
+	4. Z is the rcu_read_unlock() event marking the end of C;
 
-	5. Z is equal to or po-after the start of C.
+	5. F is the rcu_read_lock() event marking the start of C.
 
-From 2 - 4 we deduce that the grace period G ends before the critical
-section C.  Then the second part of the Grace Period Guarantee says
-not only that G starts before C does, but also that W (which executes
-on G's CPU before G starts) must propagate to every CPU before C
-starts.  In particular, W propagates to every CPU before Z executes
-(or finishes executing, in the case where Z is equal to the
-rcu_read_lock() fence event which starts C.)  This sort of reasoning
-can be expanded to handle all the situations covered by rcu-fence.
+From 1 - 4 we deduce that the grace period G ends before the critical

+In particular, the write propagates to every CPU before F finishes

+This sort of reasoning can be extended to handle all the situations
+covered by rcu-fence.
 
 Finally, the LKMM defines the RCU-before (rb) relation in terms of
 rcu-fence.  This is done in essentially the same way as the pb
 relation was defined in terms of strong-fence.  We will omit the
-details; the end result is that E ->rb F implies E must execute before
-F, just as E ->pb F does (and for much the same reasons).
+details; the end result is that E ->rb F implies E must execute
+before F, just as E ->pb F does (and for much the same reasons).
 
 Putting this all together, the LKMM expresses the Grace Period
 Guarantee by requiring that the rb relation does not contain a cycle.
-Equivalently, this "rcu" axiom requires that there are no events E and
-F with E ->rcu-link F ->rcu-fence E.  Or to put it a third way, the
-axiom requires that there are no cycles consisting of gp and rscs
-alternating with rcu-link, where the number of gp links is >= the
-number of rscs links.

 Justifying the axiom isn't easy, but it is in fact a valid
 formalization of the Grace Period Guarantee.  We won't attempt to go
 through the detailed argument, but the following analysis gives a
-taste of what is involved.  Suppose we have a violation of the first
-part of the Guarantee: A critical section starts before a grace
-period, and some store propagates to the critical section's CPU before
-the end of the critical section but doesn't propagate to some other
-CPU until after the end of the grace period.

+violated: A critical section starts before a grace period, and some
+store propagates to the critical section's CPU before the end of the
+critical section but doesn't propagate to some other CPU until after
+the end of the grace period.
 
 Putting symbols to these ideas, let L and U be the rcu_read_lock() and
 rcu_read_unlock() fence events delimiting the critical section in
 question, and let S be the synchronize_rcu() fence event for the grace
 period.  Saying that the critical section starts before S means there
-are events E and F where E is po-after L (which marks the start of the
-critical section), E is "before" F in the sense of the rcu-link
-relation, and F is po-before the grace period S:
+are events Q and R where Q is po-after L (which marks the start of the
+critical section), Q is "before" R in the sense used by the rcu-link
+relation, and R is po-before the grace period S.  Thus we have:
 
-	L ->po E ->rcu-link F ->po S.
+	L ->rcu-link S.
 
-Let W be the store mentioned above, let Z come before the end of the
+Let W be the store mentioned above, let Y come before the end of the

+section's CPU by reading from W, and let Z on some arbitrary CPU be a
+witness that W has not propagated to that CPU, where Z happens after
 some event X which is po-after S.  Symbolically, this amounts to:
 
-	S ->po X ->hb* Y ->fr W ->rf Z ->po U.
+	S ->po X ->hb* Z ->fr W ->rf Y ->po U.
 
-The fr link from Y to W indicates that W has not propagated to Y's CPU
-at the time that Y executes.  From this, it can be shown (see the
-discussion of the rcu-link relation earlier) that X and Z are related
-by rcu-link, yielding:
+The fr link from Z to W indicates that W has not propagated to Z's CPU

+by rcu-link:
 
-	S ->po X ->rcu-link Z ->po U.
+	S ->rcu-link U.
 
-The formulas say that S is po-between F and X, hence F ->gp X.  They
-also say that Z comes before the end of the critical section and E
-comes after its start, hence Z ->rscs E.  From all this we obtain:
+Since S is a grace period we have S ->rcu-gp S, and since L and U are
+the start and end of the critical section C we have U ->rcu-rscsi L.
+From this we obtain:
 
-	F ->gp X ->rcu-link Z ->rscs E ->rcu-link F,
+	S ->rcu-gp S ->rcu-link U ->rcu-rscsi L ->rcu-link S,
 
 a forbidden cycle.  Thus the "rcu" axiom rules out this violation of
 the Grace Period Guarantee.
 
 For something a little more down-to-earth, let's see how the axiom
 works out in practice.  Consider the RCU code example from above, this
-time with statement labels added to the memory access instructions:
+time with statement labels added:
 
 	int x, y;
 
 	P0()
 	{
-		rcu_read_lock();
-		W: WRITE_ONCE(x, 1);
-		X: WRITE_ONCE(y, 1);
-		rcu_read_unlock();
+		L: rcu_read_lock();
+		X: WRITE_ONCE(x, 1);
+		Y: WRITE_ONCE(y, 1);
+		U: rcu_read_unlock();
 	}
 
 	P1()
 	{
 		int r1, r2;
 
-		Y: r1 = READ_ONCE(x);
-		synchronize_rcu();
-		Z: r2 = READ_ONCE(y);
+		Z: r1 = READ_ONCE(x);
+		S: synchronize_rcu();
+		W: r2 = READ_ONCE(y);
 	}
 
 
-If r2 = 0 at the end then P0's store at X overwrites the value that
-P1's load at Z reads from, so we have Z ->fre X and thus Z ->rcu-link X.
-In addition, there is a synchronize_rcu() between Y and Z, so therefore
-we have Y ->gp Z.
+If r2 = 0 at the end then P0's store at Y overwrites the value that
+P1's load at W reads from, so we have W ->fre Y.  Since S ->po W and
+also Y ->po U, we get S ->rcu-link U.  In addition, S ->rcu-gp S
+because S is a grace period.
 
-If r1 = 1 at the end then P1's load at Y reads from P0's store at W,
-so we have W ->rcu-link Y.  In addition, W and X are in the same critical
-section, so therefore we have X ->rscs W.
+If r1 = 1 at the end then P1's load at Z reads from P0's store at X,
+so we have X ->rfe Z.  Together with L ->po X and Z ->po S, this
+yields L ->rcu-link S.  And since L and U are the start and end of a
+critical section, we have U ->rcu-rscsi L.
 
-Then X ->rscs W ->rcu-link Y ->gp Z ->rcu-link X is a forbidden cycle,
-violating the "rcu" axiom.  Hence the outcome is not allowed by the
-LKMM, as we would expect.
