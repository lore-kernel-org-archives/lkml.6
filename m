BTW, last year we were discussing something similar (I mean related to
alignment requirements) with ath10k SDIO patches and at the time the
patch submitter was proposing to have a bounce buffer in ath10k to
workaround that. I don't remember the details anymore, they are on the
ath10k mailing list archive if anyone is curious to know, but I would
not be surprised if they are similar as here. So there might be a need
to solve this in a generic way (but not sure of course as I haven't
checked the details).
