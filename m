Subject: Applied "regulator: Don't return or expect -errno from of_map_mode()" to the regulator tree

The patch

   regulator: Don't return or expect -errno from of_map_mode()

has been applied to the regulator tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/regulator.git 

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] regulator: Don't return or expect -errno from of_map_mode()

In of_get_regulation_constraints() we were taking the result of
of_map_mode() (an unsigned int) and assigning it to an int.  We were
then checking whether this value was -EINVAL.  Some implementers of
of_map_mode() were returning -EINVAL (even though the return type of
their function needed to be unsigned int) because they needed to
signal an error back to of_get_regulation_constraints().

In general in the regulator framework the mode is always referred to
as an unsigned int.  While we could fix this to be a signed int (the
highest value we store in there right now is 0x8), it's actually
pretty clean to just define the regulator mode 0x0 (the lack of any
bits set) as an invalid mode.  Let's do that.

Fixes: 5e5e3a42c653 ("regulator: of: Add support for parsing initial and suspend modes")
