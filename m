I have confirmed that the performance regression is indeed tied to
signal strength: on the good cases signal was between -16 and -8 dBm,
whereas in bad cases signal was always between -50 to - 40 dBm. I've
also switched to testing bandwidth in controlled LAN environment using
iperf3, as suggested by Steve deRosier, with the DUT being the only
machine connected to the 2.4 GHz radio and the machine running the
iperf3 server connected via ethernet.

Using those two tests (iperf3 and signal strength) I've dug deeper
into the culprit I had found previously, commit 7937f02d1953,
reverting it partially and testing the resulting driver, to isolate
which change was causing the problem. Besides "hooking up external
functions for newer ICs", as described by the commit message, that
commit also added code to decided whether ex_btc8723b1ant_*() or
ex_btc8723b2ant_*() functions should be used in halbtcoutsrc.c,
depending on the value of board_info.btdm_ant_num, whereas before that
commit ex_btc8723b2ant_*() were always used. Reverting to always using
ex_btc8723b2ant_*() functions fixes the regression on v4.15.

I've also tried to bisect between v4.15..v4.16 to find what else was
causing problems there, as the changes mentioned above on top of v4.16
did not solve the problem. The bisect pointed to "874e837d67d0
rtlwifi: fill FW version and subversion", only but reverting it plus
the changes mentioned above also didn't yield good results. That's
when I decided to get a bit creative: starting on v4.16 I first
applied the changes to have ex_btc8723b2ant_*() always being used, as
mentioned above, then reverted every commit between v4.15..v4.16
affecting drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtlwifi/, and verified the
resulting kernel had a good performance. Then I started trimming down
the history and testing along the way, to reduce to the minimum set of
changes that had to be reverted in order to restore the good
performance. In addition to the ex_btc8723b2ant_*() changes and
reverting "874e837d67d0 rtlwifi: fill FW version and subversion", I've
also had to remove the following lines from
drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtlwifi/btcoexist/halbtcoutsrc.c, which
were introduced by "40d9dd4f1c5d rtlwifi: btcoex: Remove global
variables from btcoex", in order to restore the upload performance and
signal strength.

        /* set default antenna position to main  port */
        btcoexist->board_info.btdm_ant_pos = BTC_ANTENNA_AT_MAIN_PORT;

These are the results I've got on v4.16 (similarly on
wireless-drivers-next-for-davem-2018-03-29 or v4.15):

applying the same changes on the current wireless-drivers-next master

I'll send an RFC patchset with the changes that I mentioned above.
Please advise whether those changes themselves should be merged, or if
you suggest a different approach.
