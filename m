Discussing this again is completely fine by me. I have some concerns
with this proposal though, some of which apply to our previous versions
as well.

Using "global" for granularity=0 will be confusing, let's call this
"domain" instead. In the SMMU and ATS specifications (and I think VT-d
as well), the global flag is used to invalidate VA ranges that are
cached for all PASIDs. In the Arm architecture these TLB entries are
created from PTE entries without the "nG" bit. So "global" usually means
granularity=IOMMU_IOTLB_INV_PAGE.

We might as well call this bit "INV_ADDR" to make it clear that it
describes the validity of field @addr.

Although I find the new structure and field names clearer in general, I
believe we're losing something by splitting structures this way.

The one concept I'd like to keep is the possibility to multiplex ATC and
IOTLB invalidation. That is, when unmapping a range, the guest (using a
pvIOMMU) shouldn't need to send both iotlb_inv and device_iotlb_inv to
the host - it's completely redundant. Instead the host IOMMU driver
should receive a single invalidation packet, and send both TLB and ATC
invalidation to the hardware.

So in my opinion the invalidation type needs to be a bitfield: userspace
can select either TYPE_IOTLB, TYPE_DEV_IOTLB, or both. And if type is a
bitfield, the content that follows has to be a single structure.

Same for the PASID cache: when the guest changes the config for a PASID,
it shouldn't have to also send TLB and ATC invalidations. A single
packet should be enough. However config changes won't be a fast path, so
optimizing the API is less important here.

We could say that IOMMU_INV_TYPE_IOTLB implies IOMMU_INV_TYPE_DEV_IOTLB,
and that IOMMU_INV_TYPE_PASID implies the others. In fact I think we do,
in this patch. But that in turn would be suboptimal with vSMMU and other
emulated solutions, which will receive both TLB and ATC invalidation
from the guest, and have to signal both separately to the kernel. So for
@type, a bitfield would be best.

If we want to split the structure, I think splitting by @granularity
might make more sense. It might require at least 4 structures:
* domain invalidation:		granule = 0
* pasid invalidation:		granule = pasid|archid
* global va invalidation:	granule = addr
* va invalidation		granule = pasid|archid|addr

Sure, though we could add a flags field and leave it unused for now,
which is easier to extend than introducing a new version. I wonder if
Intel's Invalidation Hint (IH) does the same as Arm's leaf flag?

I don't think sourceid is the right thing to use in this interface. The
device ID (streamid or sourceid) that the IOMMU sees in DMA transactions
isn't really made visible to userspace. And for mdev it doesn't really
exist, VFIO will have to pass the parent device's handle to IOMMU.

To userspace a device is identified by the fd provided by VFIO. So if we
do want to have device-scope in the invalidation (as opposed to
the current domain-scope) I think userspace needs to provide a device fd
to VFIO (outside the structures defined here), and then VFIO would pass
a struct device to iommu_cache_inval().

Thanks,
Jean
