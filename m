Since Bjorn asked for a spec reference:

PCIe r4.0 sec 7.8.11: "Presence Detect State - This bit indicates the
presence of an adapter in the slot, reflected by the logical OR of the
Physical Layer in-band presence detect mechanism and, if present, any
out-of-band presence detect mechanism defined for the slot's
corresponding form factor."

Table 4-14 in sec 4.2.6 is also important because it shows the difference
between Link Up and in-band presence.

So in reality, PDC and DLLSC events rarely come in simultaneously and
we do allow some leeway in pcie_wait_for_link(), it's just not enough
in your particular case due to the way presence is detected by the
platform.

I think in this case instead of changing the behavior for everyone,
it's more appropriate to add a quirk for your hardware.  Two ideas:

* Amend pcie_init() to set slot_cap |= PCI_EXP_SLTCAP_ABP.  Insert
  this as a quirk right below the existing Thunderbolt quirk and
  use PCI vendor/device IDs and/or DMI checks to identify your
  particular hardware.  If the ABP bit is set, PDC events are not
  enabled by pcie_enable_notification(), so you will solely rely on
  DLLSC events.  Problem solved.  (Hopefully.)

* Alternatively, add a DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_FINAL() quirk which sets
  pdev->link_active_reporting = false.  This causes pcie_wait_for_link()
  to wait 1100 msec before the hot-added device's config space is
  accessed for the first time.

Would this work for you?

Thanks,

Lukas
