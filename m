Oh ok then.

I think you are exaggerating a little here.  Limited access with e.g.
need to flush caches is common on lower end but less common on higher
end systems used for virtualization.  As you point out that changes with
e.g. SEV but then SEV is a pretty niche thing so far.

So I would make that a SHOULD probably.

Yes. If host does not have access to all of memory it SHOULD set
VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM.

It seems rather straight-forward to add conformance clauses
for this, thanks for reminding me.

Thanks for the reminder. Yes generally spec tends to still say e.g.
"physical address" where it really means a "DMA address" in Linux terms.
Whether changing that will make things much clearer I'm not sure. E.g.
hardware designers don't much care I guess.

If you want to list the most problematic cases, e.g. in a github issue,
we might get to clarifying them sooner.

Thanks!
