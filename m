Got it.

I don't consider it as a memory corruption until you point it out.
Will try to add slub_debug.

Not yet, I can try when it happens again.

Seems I can't check the format on a mounted fs?

$ xfs_db -x /dev/sda1
xfs_db: /dev/sda1 contains a mounted filesystem

fatal error -- couldn't initialize XFS library

The machine is already rebooted after that warning, so I don't know if
it is too late to collect xfs information, but here it is:
