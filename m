Actually this is a pin that may be driven directly by the PCI IP and is
not board-specific (note that the patch is wrong as the functions
should be "pcie" instead of "gpio"). What is board specific is if this
pin is actually wired to the endpoint PCIe card or not.

Anyway, as seen by Gregory, the pinctrl driver must be fixed as when
selecting the "pcie1" group, the driver was poking another area making
the EspressoBin switch unstable. With a quick fix on my side I realized
the reset was not behaving at all as expected. As it is not actually
needed for suspend/resume operation (at least on my setup) I will drop
the 'reset pin' related patches in the next iteration of the series.


Thanks,
Miquèl
