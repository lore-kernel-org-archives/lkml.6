I said no radical surgery, but after thinking more about it...
I am not sure.

Let's explain this:

I see 2 ways to proceed but my favorite is definitively to introduce 
versioning.


Way 1)

This was the way I first thought about.
We keep the existing IO Regionand structures, and are more
specific by stating that the io_region is a command region during write
entry and a status region during interrupt handling:
This allow us to use the 3 bits of the FCTL field of the SCSW to pass
commands to the kernel and stay backward compatible.
The FCTL field has 3 bits => we can have 8 commands.

PRO: small change

CONTRA: This is still confusing, we do not really solve this
         unclarity problem since QEMU view / documentation and
         Linux view / documentation differ or we update QEMU.
         Moreover this does not allow for long term extensions
         and/or re-design.



Way 2)

We use the device VFIO versioning using the capability chain to advertise
a new interface.

This the preferred way, it is sane, allows for the userland backward
compatibility and allows to have a new command interface, extensible
for future use.

In this case we can extend the interface to be any kind we want
in a next version, pwrite with new io_region, mmap on new
IO regions, status region...

PRO: Extensible and also goes in the VFIO INFO extension direction
      proposed by Alex

CONTRA: I see none outer more work to do (but is it a problem?)


====================

Extra argumentation for versioning support


Suppose a future implementation with 4 mapped regions like
the following:

- A Status region (RO updated as result of command and IRQ)

- A command region (WO where the user send its commands)
   userland write here to trigger IO (quite as currently)

- A CCW program region (RW where the CCW chain is handled)
   most handling done from userspace, last translations in kernel,
   double buffering...

- A performance / measurement / statistics region (RO)
   This is updated asynchronously by hardware and/or driver

This is purely theoretical and we do not need to do all at once
but if we want to extend the implementation without problems
and continue backward compatibility the versioning and capability
handling is a must.

====================

Pierre
