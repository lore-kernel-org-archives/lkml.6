I see. Now, I understand what you are talking about.

   if (common_case)
	schedule_and_wait_for_something_that_takes_a_long_time()

should be:

   if (common_case)
	schedule_and_wait_long_time_so_that_the_work_to_finish()

Absolutely true about what lockdep does.

Sure. It's not a deadlock because wait_for_completion() is not involved
in this path - where wait_for_completion() is necessary to deadlock.

Ok. I didn't know what you are talking about but now I got it.

You are talking about who knows whether common_case is true or not,
so we must aggresively consider the case the wait_for_completion()
so far hasn't been called but may be called in the future.

I think it's a problem of how aggressively we need to check dependencies.
If we choose the aggressive option, then we could get reported
aggressively but could not avoid aggresive false positives either.
I don't want to strongly argue that because it's a problem of policy.

Just, I would consider only waits that actually happened anyway. Of
course, we gotta consider the waits definitely even if any actual
deadlock doesn't happen since detecting potantial problem is more
important than doing on actual ones as you said.

So no big objection to check dependencies aggressively.

You misunderstand me. The commit should be reverted or acquire/release
pairs should be added in both flush functions.

Anyway the annotation should be placed in the path where
wait_for_completion() might be called. But whether doing it
regardless of invoking wait_for_completion() or not is a problem of
policy so I don't care. No big objection whichever you do.

No no. Your example was helpful to understand what you are talking about.
I asked you for a potential deadlock example.

Absolutly true. You can find my opinion about that in
Documentation/locking/crossrelease.txt which has been removed because
crossrelease is strong at detecting *potential* deadlock problems.

I didn't know if you were talking about this in the previous talk.
