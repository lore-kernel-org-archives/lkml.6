Phew, had me worried :-)

Sort of.  A guest that is running under KVM (i.e. VMX) is much more
contained than a random userspace program.  A rogue enclave in a VMX
guest can attack the guest kernel/OS, but barring a bug (or more likely,
several major bugs) elsewhere in the virtualization stack the enclave
can't do anything nasty to the host.  An enclave would let someone hide
code, but enclaves are even more restricted than cpl3, i.e. there's not
a lot it can do without coordinating with unencrypted code in the guest.

And if someone has sufficient permissions to run a KVM guest, they're
much more likely to do something malcious in the guest kernel, not an
enclave.

All that aside, I don't see any justification for singling out SGX for
extra scrutiny, there are other ways for a user with KVM permissions to
hide malicious code in guest (and at cpl0!), e.g. AMD's SEV{-ES}.
