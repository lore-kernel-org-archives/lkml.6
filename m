Yeah, so the problem here is that the feature is the _lack_ of legacy 
ARCH_USES_GETTIMEOFFSET, so we cannot just invert the check - the output would be 
rather confusing ...

Negating the switch in the kernel would force us to add a "arch uses modern 
timekeeping" flag to every other architecture - not a very good solution.

I'd suggest adding support for a simple '!' operator with very strict syntax - 
nothing more. (This would also be useful for (b), see below.)

I'd suggest removing both :-)

- strncasecmp() is an insignificant API and no arch has optimized it so far.
- __HAVE_ARCH_PTE_SPECIAL is really a hardware detail.

Yes, !RWSEM_GENERIC_SPINLOCK expresses this equivalently. If you implement the NOT 
operator for ARCH_USES_GETTIMEOFFSET then it would handle this one as well.
