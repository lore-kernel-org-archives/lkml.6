Eric, we know what fuzzing is.

If people listened to us rather just throwing stuff over the wall at
us, they'd already know that our own fuzzing code works on v5
filesystems and that it has found a lot more problems in recent
times than syzbot has.

And they'd also know that our own fuzzing stuff provides us with
easily debuggable, reproducable test cases instead of opaque,
difficult to analyse reports of things we already know about and
can't fix in a legacy on-disk format. i.e. it already does all the
things we're asking from the syzbot fuzzing.

Yup, but then the severity and impact of the problem the bug exposes
has to weighed against the risk it poses to the userbase, and the
impact the fix will have on the userbase. We went through this
process several years ago for this specific problem, like we do for
all on-disk format bugs.

Keep in mind that filesystems are persistent structures that have
lifetimes of tens of years. We have to support users with old
formats, regardless of the unfixable problems they may have. We do
what we can to mitigate those issues for them and encourage users to
upgrade their kernels and on-disk formats, but we can't just shut
off access to the old formats in new kernels because a new fuzzer
found an old problem we've known about for years.

[ FYI, this report is for an on-disk v4 format bug that was
introduced into mkfs about 15 years ago.  It has since been fixed
for both v4 and v5 filesystems (~4 years ago, IIRC), but still
leaves us with about a really, really long tail of production v4
format filesystems with the on-disk format bug present in them.

IOWs, when we came across this problem, we had the choice of two
things when initially validating the log size:

- only warning users of v4 filesystems and leaving them exposed to a
  bug that could caused runtime hangs in very rare corner cases
  (very low risk); or

- preventing them from accessing their filesystems and data on
  kernel upgrade, thereby directly affecting millions of existing
  filesystems in production around the world.

In this case, the *choice of least harm* was to warn about the
problem for v4 filesystems and continue onwards, but to reject
mounts that failed log size validation on the new v5 filesystem
because the on-disk format bug is fixed in v5 filesystems. ]

What's the point of doing that when the attacker can just move to
some other exploitable filesystem e.g.  ext2/3/4, vfat, btrfs, hfs,
etc? They have known vulnerable and exploitable on disk formats,
too.

i.e. this isn't an "XFS problem", this is a "all current block
device based kernel filesystems are built on top of a trust model
that breaks down when 3rd party storage access is allowed" problem.
This is not solvable by just saying "don't use filesystem X"....

That's just hyperbole - software /by definition/ is known to be
buggy. And all Linux filesystems have unfixable, known bugs when it
comes to 3rd party manipulation of their on-disk format and that's the
reality we live in right now. How we chose to deal with that is
not a black/white decision (as I outlined above) - every distro has
users of the legacy XFS format, so even if we made it a config
option it will never be turned off in shipping distros kernels.

IOWs, mitigation decisions are difficult, but we have to draw a line
somewhere. In the case of XFS, we decided that the legacy format
needs to remain accepting of some bad input so users of those
formats don't get nasty surprises, but all new formats will strictly
validate all inputs and reject anything invalid. i.e. we get better
as time goes on, and that's why we want syzbot and other fuzzers to
focus on finding flaws in the new formats rather than the old.

Cheers,

-Dave.
