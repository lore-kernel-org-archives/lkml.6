For operations that are shared with ptrace it does make sense to have a
task argument, but in the end I found it equally natural to put that
only in the backend rather than having it invoked directly with an
explicit argument by the prctl demux.

In the case of PR_SVE_SET_VL the interface has to be massaged in
different ways depending on whether it's being invokved via prctl or
ptrace anyway, so I guess there was no temptation to keep the task
argument on the prctl side in this case.

Ptrace differs from prctl in that in the former case we can assume
the task is stopped and in the latter we can't.  This results in
some conditional local_bh_disable()..local_bh_enable() in
sve_set_vector_length(), which is a bit gross.  Maybe it's best not
to encourage ptrace and prctl to be given the same backend functions
without thinking about it.

(See the different callers of sve_set_vector_length() under arch/arm64/.)


Others' views may differ though, so I'm happy to be overruled on this if
people object.

Agreed.  Actually, it was originally called arch_prctl(), until I
discovered that it broke um.  x86 seems happy enough, since its
existing arch_prctl() functions all have do_/sys_/etc. prefixes.

So, you mean we merge x86's arch_prctl() syscall with the generic one,
and have both syscalls from userland invoke the common backend?

That does look kind of feasible, given the compatible ABI and the
fact that there does not appear to be a namespace clash in the option
values.

I didn't really like overloading the name "arch_prctl" at all, since
this is established as the name of the existing x86 syscall.  Even if
we arrange things in the kernel so that there is no linkage namespace
clash, there seemed to be high risk of confusion.

If we can merge the two (as suggested above) then that might be
acceptable, but I wasn't confident that there were no subtle gotchas
with such an approach...

Thoughts?
