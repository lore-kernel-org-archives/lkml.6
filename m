Ok, this series is really impressive at its RFC stage already!

Beyond fixing those warnings, I'd also suggest another change: please make the 
new BPF features patch the last one, so that the 'refresh' patch shows how much 
original bit-rot we gathered recently.

The 'new features' patch should then also include the result of also running the 
script, i.e. a single patch adding the base fields and the generated parts as 
well. That will be the usual development flow anyway - people won't do two-part 
patches just to show which bits are by hand and which are auto-generated.

Thanks,

	Ingo
