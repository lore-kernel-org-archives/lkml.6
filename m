That would only be needed if the NVMEM framework would do "forward"
parsing, creating data structure for each NVMEM cell found under an
NVMEM provider. However currently it doesn't do that and only goes
"backward", starting by resolving a phandle pointing to a cell, then
finding the provider that the cell belongs to.

This also has the side effect that nvmem cells defined in DT don't
appear in sysfs, unlike those defined from board code.

For pinctrl I do understand, these beast can be very different from SoC
to SoC, having a single biding for all doesn't make much sense.

However here we are talking about a simple linear storage, nothing
special at all. I could see the need for an xlate to for example
support a device with several partitions, but not to just allow each
driver to have slightly incompatible bindings.

As I explained above that is not currently the case. If the NVMEM,
framework is ever changed to explicitly parse NVMEM cells in advance
we can first update the few existing users to add the compatible string.

A review of a new DTS should check that it use each binding correctly,
AFAIK the DT people do that. We could also add a warning when there is
no compatible string, that would also help pushing people to update
their DTS.

That should be trivial to implement.
