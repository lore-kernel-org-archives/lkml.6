Out of interest, how does that part work? AFAICS, modifying a PGD entry 
involves writing to kernel memory, which would mean the implication of 
KSMA is "userspace can gain write permission to kernel memory by writing 
to kernel memory" - that doesn't sound like an attack in itself, more 
just a convenience for ease of exploiting whatever successful attack got 
you in there in the first place.

That's not to say that it isn't still worth mitigating, I'm just 
questioning the given rationale here.
