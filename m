No, because most corruption problems we fix are rarely seen by
users. Those that are seen or considered a significant risk are
backported as per the usual process. What we don't do is shovel
things that *look like fixes* back in older kernels.

This is the third time in recent weeks where I've had to explain
this. e.g:

https://marc.info/?l=linux-xfs&m=152103080002315&w=2

And note Christoph's followup:
https://marc.info/?l=linux-xfs&m=152103175702634&w=2

What's important to note is that the discussion in that thread lead
to the patch being backported, validated and then included in Greg's
stable tree.

Validating that backports to all the stable kernels is effectively a
full time job in itself, and we simply don't have enough upstream
developer resources available to do that. So it's a simple: if we
don't have the resources to validate changes properly, then we
*don't change the code*.

I'm not the XFS maintainer (haven't been for 18 months now), I don't
subscribe to LKML anymore and none of my patches were selected for
backports. So, no, I had no idea this was going on.

How much time are your test rigs going to be able to spend running
xfstests? A single pass on a single filesysetm config on spinning
disks will take 3-4 hours of run time. And we have at least 4 common
configs that need validation (v4, v4 w/ 512b block size, v5
(defaults), and v5 w/ reflink+rmap) and so you're looking at a
minimum 12-24 hours of machine test time per kernel you'd need to
test.

And that's just for XFS. There's the same sort of basic
configuration matrix test for ext4 (Ted does it via kvm-xfstests on
GCE which, IIRC takes about 20 hours to run) and btrfs has similar
test requirements. Then there's f2fs, overlay, etc.

You can probably start to see the scope of the validation problem
stable kernels pose, and this is just for filesystem changes....

That might help, but the testing and validation is completely
opaque. If I wanted to know what that "OK!" actually meant, where
do I go to find that out?

It's not a reflection on the -stable process, it's a reflection on
the amount of work validation of filesystem changes require. If we
decide to do backports, the -stable process will work just fine for
the mechanical code movement into the stable trees. It's all the
extra stuff before and after that movement occurs that incurs the
resource costs.

See the link I posted above - I explicitly address the overhead
involved in adding "fixes" tags and identifying backport targets.
And even without the overhead of having to add "fixes" tags, the
broader point I'm making about effectively random selection of
commits for backports is very relevant to the auto-backport magic
we've just learnt about...

Cheers,

Dave.
