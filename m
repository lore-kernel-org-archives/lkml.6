I thought we established in the previous discussion that this could
cause some functions to get skipped in the stack trace:

Page faults and preemption.

It looks like show_stack() already knows how to do this:

		/*
		 * See if this is an exception frame.
		 * We look for the "regshere" marker in the current frame.
		 */
		if (validate_sp(sp, tsk, STACK_INT_FRAME_SIZE)
		    && stack[STACK_FRAME_MARKER] == STACK_FRAME_REGS_MARKER) {

So you could do something similar.

I don't really follow, where exactly would you propose calling
ftrace_graph_ret_addr() from?

If you're going to make livepatch incompatible with function graph
tracing, there needs to be a good justification for it (and we'd need to
make sure existing users are fine with it).
