Great, I'd be much happier avoiding that IPI. I guess it should happen
quite rarely that we have to queue on a different CPU. I would say just
do add_timer unless we have migrated to the wrong CPU, then do add_timer_on
in that case (it's a bit slower).

Something I noticed is that if we can not get the lock (trylock fails),
then the timer does not get queued again. Should it?

Thanks,
