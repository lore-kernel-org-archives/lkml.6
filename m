Isn't that 063246641d4a9e9de84a2466fbad50112faf88dc in mainline ;) ?
BTW, I don't agree with all the changes in there: For auto variables, this

-       const char *cur_drv, *drv = "acpi-cpufreq";
+       const char drv[] = "acpi-cpufreq";
+       const char *cur_drv;

makes gcc actually generate that string on the stack instead of just
referring to an anonymous object in .rodata; one gets code gen like

+:      31 c0                   xor    %eax,%eax
+:      48 b8 61 63 70 69 2d    movabs $0x7570632d69706361,%rax # "acpi-cpu"
+:      63 70 75
+:      c7 44 24 0b 66 72 65    movl   $0x71657266,0xb(%rsp) # "freq"
+:      71
+:      c6 44 24 0f 00          movb   $0x0,0xf(%rsp) "\0"
+:      48 89 44 24 03          mov    %rax,0x3(%rsp)

It's not the-end-of-the-world-horrible, but it's better avoided,
especially for patches that are not supposed to change anything. And
longer strings would of course produce even more gunk like the above.
A better fix which also silences -Wformat-security is to declare the
variable itself const, i.e.

const char *const drv = "acpi-cpufreq".

Yes, gcc should be able to infer the constness of drv from the fact that
it's never assigned to elsewhere in the function... I think I saw that
on some gcc todo list at some point.

I don't agree. Yes, a human can verify that _currently_, only "pencrypt"
and "pdecrypt" can ever reach pcrypt_sysfs_add(). But without the
compiler being smart enough to do that, one will never know if some new
caller shows up, or one of those literals grows a % for some reason.
Adding "%s" doesn't cost much, especially not in cases (like this one)
where the fmt+args end up at kobject_set_name_vargs - for a "%s" +
literal that does a (succesful) kstrdup_const(), so we never even hit
the vsnprintf() engine.

Probably less than the VLA removal. But it kind of depends on which
tools one allows. I can't see how to do it without something like
fmtcheck() to annotate certain places (e.g. the nfs example). Maybe a
no_fmtcheck() to annotate places which have been manually verified
[modulo the above "but that may change..."] would also be needed
(no_fmtcheck would be the same as fmtcheck for at !CONFIG_FMTCHECK
kernel), similar to how we have no_printk.

I kind of agree with Guenther that the hwmon example is a bad one. It
would be better to have the compiler check all those string literals
against a pattern at build time. Probably the format template plugin can
be extended to apply to any "const char*" declaration, not just those
sitting inside structs. But I'd rather get fmtcheck() in first before
returning to work on that plugin.
