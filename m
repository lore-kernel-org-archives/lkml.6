I tried to look through the QMI dumps we have in libqmi from 2013
(latest Qualcomm posted) and couldn't find anything to do with mic
control, speaker volume, or anything like that.

If the modem supports the AT service (which I think it does?  Not
looking at the libqmi dumps right now) then it could potentially tunnel
these AT commands through QMI too.

Perhaps Qualcomm added something to the Voice service after 2013, or
perhaps there are other services that might control speaker/mic that we
don't have public dumps for yet though.
