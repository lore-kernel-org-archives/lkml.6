Fascinating.

We've been carrying a patch, that drops in on top of the proposed
kernel driver, that implements the needed policy management framework
for DAC fragile (FLC) platforms.  After a meeting yesterday with the
client that is funding the work, a decision was made to release the
enhancements when the SGX driver goes mainline.  That will at least
give developers the option of creating solutions on Linux that
implement the security guarantees that SGX was designed to deliver.

Most importantly, since it implements a driver consistent with the
design of SGX, it has the added benefit of allowing system
administrators the ability to enable the driver to work on non-FLC
(locked) platforms.  Since Jarkko confirmed that FLC is the option of
platform vendors, this would seem to be important as SGX on Linux will
only work in a random fashion dependent on the whims of hardware OEM's
in probably a SKU dependent fashion.  Which is why the client has
interest in the work.

Best wishes for a productive remainder of the week.
