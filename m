I had decided that I'm not taking any tda998x stuff until we get the
CEC support merged upstream, as that has been hanging around for ages.
Progress has been slow on that, but it finally got to the point where
everyone was happy with it, and I sent a pull request to David Airlie
on April 24th for it.

Unfortunately, that pull request has not been actioned to date.  I've
sent a chaser, and last night, I checked with David Airlie on IRC.
It seems David is not aware of my pull request.  David says he'll look
into this on Monday.

Until David does take it, I can't add anything further to my git tree
for tda998x development, as that would change what was sent to David
back in April.

The alternative would be for drm-misc to take it - I don't think it
will conflict with anything I've already asked David to take, so that
should be a safe route for _this_ patch.
