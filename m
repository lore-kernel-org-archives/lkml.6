I don't see such code. The current do_cow_fault() implemenation has nothing to
do with mm_notifer.

Yes. We are not focusing on the current implementation. As mentioned in the
cover letter. We are expecting Jean Philips' SVA patch:
git://linux-arm.org/linux-jpb.

Yes. That's our first expectation. We can keep it with our driver. But because
there is no user driver support for any accelerator in mainline kernel. Even the
well known QuickAssit has to be maintained out of tree. So we try to see if
people is interested in working together to solve the problem.

Yes. That is what is done in our RFCv1/v2. But we accepted Jerome's opinion and
try not to add complexity to the mm subsystem.

Yes. If no other accelerator driver writer is interested. That is the
expectation:)

But we really like to have a public solution here. Consider this scenario:

You create some connections (queues) to NIC, RSA, and AI engine. Then you got
data direct from the NIC and pass the pointer to RSA engine for decryption. The
CPU then finish some data taking or operation and then pass through to the AI
engine for CNN calculation....This will need a place to maintain the same
address space by some means.

It is not complex, but it is helpful.

OK. Thanks. I will spend some time on it. But personally, I really don't like
RDMA's complexity. I cannot even try one single function without a...some
expensive hardwares and complexity connection in the lab. This is not like a
open source way.
