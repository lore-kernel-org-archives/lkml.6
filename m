Here's what I came up with. I don't really like it, but that's
the least invasive this I could come up with. Please let me
know if that helps with your test case. Note that I have only
boot-tested this on a sample of 1 machine, so I don't expect this
to be perfect.

Also, any guideline on how to reproduce this would be much appreciated.
I never used this mdev/mtty thing, so please bear with me.

Thanks,

	M.

Subject: [PATCH] KVM: arm/arm64: Do not rely on LR state to guess EOI MI
 status

We so far rely on the LR state to decide whether the guest has
EOI'd a level interrupt or not. While this looks like a good
idea on the surface, it leads to a couple of annoying corner
cases:

Example 1: (P = Pending, A = Active, MI = Maintenance Interrupt)
P -> guest IAR -> A -> exit/entry -> P+A -> guest EOI -> P -> MI

The state is now pending, we've really EOI'd the interrupt, and
yet lr_signals_eoi_mi() returns false, since the state is not 0.
The result is that we won't signal anything on the corresponding
irqfd, which people complain about. Meh.

Example 2:
P+A -> guest EOI -> P -> delayed MI -> guest IAR -> A -> MI fires

Same issue: state isn't 0, and nothing happens.

The core of the problem is that we can't decide on whether an
interrupt has been EOId by just looking at the LR if we ever
want to support the P+A state, as things do change behind our back.

An alternative to dropping P+A is to bring back our friend EISR,
which indicates which LRs have generated a MI. Instead of dragging
the state around like we used to do, use it to clear the EOI bit
from the in-memory copy, and use that as a predicate to find out
if it fired or not.
