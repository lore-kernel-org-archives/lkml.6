My concern has always been whether the PF driver is trusted and by
dropping the vfio bits, the remaining drivers here are native, trusted,
host drivers, so I don't see that we have any reason to consider the
VFs as anything other than trusted as well.  It's VFs where the PF
driver is untrusted, such as a userspace driver, which needs some kind
of quarantine, imo.  Thanks,

Alex
