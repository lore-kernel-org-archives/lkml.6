The v1 of the patch gave a unique name ("haes") to the CryptoCell HW
key format, since the information in the key for CryptoCell and the
s390 is very different (in short: cryptocell uses key size + slot
index, s390 provide an key encrypted by a HW known key).
Herbert expressed the sentiment that since the user needs to be aware
of the specific format of the token for each device anyway, she must
be aware of which tfm provider is being used anyway, so must be using
the device specific name.
Hence, I change the name to use "paes" just like the s390.

It's pretty obvious that the s390 and CryptoCell HW/protected keys
don't have anything in common and are not interchangeable.
I would say that if the ecc508 tokens are yet a third format, we
should follow the same example and just leave it as "paes" and let the
user specify an exact device name.

However, if we can find a common token format for ecc508 with either
CryptoCell or the s390 (probably less likely), maybe its worth using a
common name for those and a different for the outlier?
