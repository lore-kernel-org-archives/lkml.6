That program is *very* good to have. Whew. Anyway, it looks like read bandwidth 
is approximately 74 MiB/s with my patch (it varies a bit, run to run),
as compared to around 85 without the patch, so still showing about a 20%
performance degradation, assuming I'm reading this correctly.

Raw data follows, using the fio options you listed above:
