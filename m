I don't understand why we need new p2p_[un]map function pointers for
this. In subsequent patches, they never appear to be set anywhere and
are only called by the HMM code. I'd have expected it to be called by
some core VMA code and set by HMM as that's what vm_operations_struct is
for.

But the code as all very confusing, hard to follow and seems to be
missing significant chunks. So I'm not really sure what is going on.
