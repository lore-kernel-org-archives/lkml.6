We could do that, but for critical regulators it's a bit tricky. Like the
issue with vmmc and vqmmc, where the driver for the regulator is missing,
leading to an unusable system.

We need to add the compatible to the I2C side of the AXP driver. Also
the property for "standalone mode". I believe I already touched on this
before in another discussion with Icenowy.

No it won't. See above about the I2C driver.
