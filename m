Or supporting reduced FME plus hardware-based FPGA manager.

Just to re-emphasize, the basic intent of the FPGA manager subsystem
in the first place is to have FPGA managers separate from higher level
frameworks so that the higher level frameworks will be able to able to
use different FPGAs.

What would prevent reusing dfl-fme-pr.c?  It looks like this is 98% of
the way there and only needs a way of knowing which FPGA manager
driver to alloc here. I am hoping that a new PR sub feature could be
added and that dfl-fme-pr.c can be reused.

So this dfl-fme-pr.c would have to know where some ID registers are
and the enumeration gets messier.  Some of the enumeration would be
DFL and some would be from information that is not in the DFL headers.
The DFL should contain the knowledge of which mgr to use.

DT exists for busses that don't have that kind of discovery.  For a
concrete example, consider how the Arria10 driver (socfpga-a10.c)
probe function is getting its two mmio spaces and clock.

That sounds like a workaround.  Since you're adding a new method of
enumeration, you should use that new method of enumeration to choose
which FPGA manager is being used.  Otherwise we are ending up with
multi-level enumeration, i.e. look at the DFL and then look at a
specific register location in the device.

That sounds good.  That makes the mgr driver its own separate thing
which is what is supposed to happen in this framework.
