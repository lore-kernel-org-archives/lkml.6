I'd suggest [1] should be a part of the patchset so we can actually see
a user of the stuff you're adding.

But it still doesn't explain everything as without the HMM code nothing
calls the new vm_ops. And there's still no callers for the p2p_test
functions you added. And I still don't understand why we need the new
vm_ops or who calls them and when. Why can't drivers use the existing
'fault' vm_op and call a new helper function to map p2p when appropriate
or a different helper function to map a large range in its mmap
operation? Just like regular mmap code...
