Your approach seems useful if there are lots of locked pages sharing
the same wait queue.  

That said, in the original workload from our customer with the long wait queue
problem, there was a single super hot page getting migrated, and it
is being accessed by all threads which caused the big log jam while they wait for
the migration to get completed.  
With your approach, we will still likely end up with a long queue 
in that workload even if we have per page wait queue.

Thanks.
