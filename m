I'm OK with major probe code refactoring as long as it's done
carefully.  Doing a special-case fix like this solves the immediate
problem but adds to the long-term maintenance problem.

As far as I can tell, everything in pci_bridge_check_ranges() should
be done once at enumeration-time, e.g., in the pci_read_bridge_bases()
path, and pci_bridge_check_ranges() itself should be removed.

If that turns out to be impossible for some reason, we need a comment
explaining why.
