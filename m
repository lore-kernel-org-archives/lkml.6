Ok, very good. Being able to build abiv2 is probably sufficient for testing
the kernel in a meaningful way, and if you are working on getting that
upstream, I trust that it will happen quick enough. I can always provide
toolchain binaries on kernel.org based a prerelease version like I did
for openrisc, which makes it accessible to other kernel developers doing
cross-arch changes.
