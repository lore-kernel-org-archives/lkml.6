For fscrypt (aka ext4/f2fs/ubifs encryption), rather than a "container keyring",
I think it's much better served by ioctls to add/remove keys directly to/from
the filesystem, as I'm proposing here:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/cover/10806425/.  My proposed API implements all
the semantics people actually need for fscrypt, including:

- Making the filesystem's ability to use keys match the locked/unlocked state of
  encrypted files, which is a filesystem-wide thing not a per-process thing.

- Allowing a key to be removed and wiped, *and* the corresponding encrypted
  files locked efficiently.

- Still permitting non-root users to use fscrypt, subject to limitations; e.g.
  keys are identified by cryptographic hash, users are limited by the keys
  quotas, and a user can't directly remove a key another user has added or
  create a new encrypted directory without proving they know/knew the key.

A "container keyring" would only address the first problem.

I don't think it's the right semantics to have the kernel's ability to use
fscrypt keys be conditional on which process is doing the filesystem access --
even if the processes are divided into different sessions, users, or containers.
Doing so may sound good, but it plays into common misconceptions about the
purpose of storage encryption.  It would actually be an OS-level access control
policy that has nothing to do with the encryption itself.  The kernel already
has a wide variety of file access control mechanisms to choose from: file mode
bits, ACLs, SELinux, mount namespaces, etc...

The purpose of fscrypt is actually very different.  It's designed to protect
data locally stored on-disk from two classes of attackers: (1) attackers who can
read directly from disk, and (2) attackers who fully compromise the system
on-line including all memory, provided that the key isn't currently added.

In these cases, the notion of a "container" is meaningless as the operating
system is already out of the picture...

I also don't see much benefit to namespacing fscrypt keys for container
isolation purposes.  If it's at all computationally feasible for keys to
collide, then the encryption has already been massively screwed up.

Also, I don't think that fscrypt should have a de-facto dependency on
CONFIG_CONTAINERS in order to have sane semantics.  fscrypt is used on many
systems where containers support would be unnecessary bloat and attack surface.

So while there probably are still good arguments for adding a container keyring,
I don't think it's the best way forward for fscrypt.
