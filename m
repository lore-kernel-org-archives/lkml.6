This all seems like it's an HMM problem and not related to mapping
BARs/"potential BARs" to userspace. If some code wants to DMA map HMM
pages, it calls an HMM function to map them. If HMM needs to consult
with the driver on aspects of how that's mapped, then that's between HMM
and the driver and not something I really care about. But making the
entire mapping stuff tied to userspace VMAs does not make sense to me.
What if somebody wants to map some HMM pages in the same way but from
kernel space and they therefore don't have a VMA?

Well, this has little do with the backing device but how the memory is
mapped into userspace. With p2p_ioremap_device_memory() the entire range
is mapped into the userspace VMA immediately during the call to mmap().
With p2p_fault_device_memory(), mmap() would not actually map anything
and a page in the VMA would be mapped only when userspace accesses it
(using fault()). It seems to me like GPUs would prefer the latter but if
HMM takes care of the mapping from userspace potential pages to actual
GPU pages through the BAR then that may not be true.
