Probably.  I expect at some point the technique signalfd has been using
won't scale.  Most of what are missing are synchronous exceptions but
the crazy seccomp extensions might be missing as well.  I say crazy
because seccomp places an integer immediately after a pointer which
makes 32bit 64bit compatibility impossible.

But sigval_t with nothing after it is not incompatible between 32bit and
64bit.  With nothing after it sigval_t in struct siginfo already has
the extra 32bits you would need.  It is sort of like transparently
adding a __u64 member to the union.

That is where we really are with sigval_t.   Except for some crazy
corner cases.

Yes.

I was thinking in general and for something that would be enough to back
sigqueue, and normal kill semantics.

For Christians proposed system call I can think of two ways we could go:

	long procfd_sigsend(int fd, int sig, int si_code, __u64 sigval);

Where sigval is an appropriately written version of union sigval that
works on both 32bit and 64bit.  Or we could go with:

	long procfd_sigqueueinfo(int fd, struct siginfo_subset *info)

Both would support the same set of system calls today and both would
have some similar challenges.  Both would take an si_code value of
SI_USER as a request that the kernel fill in the struct siginfo as kill
would.  As otherwise it is invalid for userspace to send a signal with
SI_USER.  I would not worry about the signal injection case for CRIU
where we explicitly allow any siginfo to be sent if we are sending it to
ourselves.  We already have a system call for that.

What I would do is carefully define siginfo_subset architecturally as
a proper subset of siginfo on each architecture.  That in most if not
all cases will work on 32bit and 64bit.   Because of the extra padding
after union sigval.

That siginfo_subset userspace could just consider a siginfo_t.  We would
just leave out the trouble some bits.  So we could do a simple
untranslated copy_from_user on it, and then validate that si_code is in
a range we support.

That definition of siginfo_subset doesn't preclude extensions in the
future.  And so it could very much be a pass through interface on 32bit
on 64bit and into everyone's existing stack frames that embed siginfo.

So if we want to fix the situation that is what I would do, as userspace
is not allowed to send any of the problematic siginfo definitions today.

There might be some finicky detail of union sigval or some architure
might have funny alignment between 32bit and 64bit, but I don't think
there is.  If we want to be more flexible than my procfd_sigsend above
I think we should definitely look at that.

No.  signalfd_siginfo offers much less future extensibility because it
must be translated.  Once you can not just pass the structure through
you fail.  As you can't be transparently forward compatible.

In a similar way Linux filesystems written assuming all the world was
ascii wound up forward compatible with utf8 as they are both byte
encodings of strings that can use a NULL terminator.

No.  I was bringing this up because it will work for procfd_signal.  See
above.  It supports every signal userspace can send today.  We should be
able to specify it in a way that is compatible with the existing siginfo
definitions on all architectures.

For signalfd or let me say a future signalfd2 the practical problem is
that we have Linux specific signal extensions that are not synchronous
signals like seccomp and sigchld that have fields in a bad location.

If we successfully define a siginfo_subset that is the same on
32bit and 64bit  I would include the defintion in the kernels definition
of siginfo_t so new extensions are automatically picked up and require
any extensions to siginfo_t to be added to siginfo_subset_t, in the
appropriate 32bit/64bit way.

My point is that we are better sticking with siginfo_t or just cherry
picking the relevant fields and making them system call parameters.

The only advantage of using siginfo_t is forwards compatibility.  If we
give up forward compatibility we can just as easily have our system call
prototype include  "...(...,  int sig, int code, union sigval value)"
for the definition of the signal bits.  Simple easy and enough for all
posix signals.
