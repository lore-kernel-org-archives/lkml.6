Did you get a reference, e.g., an intel.com URL for that?  Intel
usually publishes errata for hardware defects, which is nice because
it means every customer doesn't have to experimentally rediscover
them.

I think there are two possible explanations for this:

  1) This device requires a Windows or a driver update with a
  device-specific quirk similar to what you're proposing for Linux.

  2) Windows correctly detects that this device doesn't support D3,
  and Linux has a bug and does not detect that.

Obviously nobody wants to require OS or driver updates just for minor
device changes, and the PCI and ACPI specs are designed to allow
generic, non device-specific code to detect D3 support, so the first
case should be a result of a hardware defect.

OK.  Since that's in drivers/net/..., I have no objection and the
e1000e maintainers would deal with that.
