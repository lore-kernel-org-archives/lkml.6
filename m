Unless the nvmem cell node has a compatible string, then it won't be
considered as a partition by the MTD code. That is were the clash is,
both bindings allow free named child nodes without a compatible string.

I really don't get what the point of this would be. Make the whole API
useless?

This is not good. First the NVMEM device is only a virtual concept of
the Linux kernel, it has no place in the DT. Secondly the NVMEM
provider (here the MTD device) then has to manually parse its DT node to
find this subnode, pass it to the NVMEM framework to later again
resolve it back to the MTD device. Not very complex but still a lot of
useless code, just registering the MTD device is a lot simpler and much
more inline with most other kernel API that register a "service"
available from a device.

That sound like a poor workaround. Remember that this problem could
appear with any device that has a binding that use child nodes.

That is a bit cleaner, but I don't think it would be worse the
complexity. Furthermore xlate functions are more about converting
from hardware parameters to internal kernel representation than to hide
extra DT parsing.

If so please match on compatible and not on the node name.

6/ Extend the current NVMEM cell lookup to check if the parent node of
the cell has a compatible string set to "nvmem-cells". If it doesn't it
mean we have the current binding and this node is the NVMEM device. If
it does the device node is just the next parent. This is trivial to
implement (literally 2 lines of code) and cover all the cases currently
known.

7/ Just add a compatible string to the nvmem cell. No code change is
needed, however as the nvmem cells have an address space (the offset in
byte in the storage) it might still clash with another address space
used by the main device biding (for example a number of child
functions).

>=20
> Alban, Srinivas, any opinion?

My preference goes to 6/ as it is trivial to implement, solves all
known shortcomings and is backward compatible with the current binding.
All other solutions have limitations and/or require too complex
implementations compared to what they try to solve.
