That looks like an undocumented side effect to me. I would rather see an
explicit control file that enable root_domain and break it free from
cpu_exclusive && !sched_load_balance, e.g. sched_root_domain(?).

Yes, that is the current plan.

Cgroup v2 is supposed to allow us to have a fresh start to rethink what
is a more sane way of partitioning resources without worrying about
backward compatibility. So I think it is time to design a new way for
deadline tasks to work with cpuset v2.
