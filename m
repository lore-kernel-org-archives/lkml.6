No idea.  With the virtualenv instructions I get:

$ pip list | egrep -i '(sphinx|docutils)'
docutils         0.12   
Sphinx           1.4.9  
sphinx-rtd-theme 0.4.0  

With Ubuntu 18.04 I get:

$ dpkg -l | egrep -i '(sphinx|docutils)' | awk '{print $2, $3}' | sort -k 2
docutils-common 0.14+dfsg-3
python3-docutils 0.14+dfsg-3
python3-sphinx-rtd-theme 0.2.4-1
sphinx-rtd-theme-common 0.2.4-1
python3-alabaster 0.7.8-1
libjs-sphinxdoc 1.6.7-1ubuntu1
python3-sphinx 1.6.7-1ubuntu1
sphinx-common 1.6.7-1ubuntu1

Ok, newer docutils, maybe that's what it is?

With Ubuntu 16.04 I get:

$ dpkg -l | egrep -i '(sphinx|docutils)' | awk '{print $2, $3}' | sort -k 2
docutils-common 0.12+dfsg-1
python-docutils 0.12+dfsg-1
python-sphinx-rtd-theme 0.1.9-1
sphinx-rtd-theme-common 0.1.9-1
python-alabaster 0.7.7-1
libjs-sphinxdoc 1.3.6-2ubuntu1.1
python-sphinx 1.3.6-2ubuntu1.1
sphinx-common 1.3.6-2ubuntu1.1

and now I'm just confused since 16.04 has the same version of docutils
and an older sphinx and runs fine; but 18.04 has newer docutils and
newer sphinx and runs fine.

Yes.  This makes writing broadly portable markup difficult -- originally
I did not take the '=' all the way to the right edge of the table
because I saw that last example in the above document and assumed that
it wasn't necessary to extend the '=' all the way to the right edge.
Neither Ubuntu system choked on it, so is this a bug in upstream?  Some
strange patch added by the distro?  Something that ended up in the
python wheel?  Or a bug in the spec?
