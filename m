_Sadly_ enough, co-developers and I were aware of this issue,
but it was only mildly reported here (c.f.,

  https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=151638196427685&w=2 ).

This bisects to that (crazy):

  2d5fba7782d669c6a1cc577dbc3bf507780273bb
  ("linux-kernel*: Make RCU identifiers match ASPLOS paper")

  From repo.: https://github.com/aparri/memory-model

which not only did break 7.47, but also made the bell uglier
by mixing dashes and underscores in a very same block.

As a solution to this issue, I can envisage a partial revert
of that commit (just replace those dashes); Paul, Jade, Luc:
any better solution?

(Sorry for being late on IRC, glad this came out here,)
