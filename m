James,
   Thank you for your time to reply me.

For the armv8.0 cpu without RAS Extensions, it does not have vsesr_el2, so when guest take a virtual SError,
its ESR is 0, can not control the virtual SError's syndrom value, it does not have such registers to control that.

Does Juno not have RAS Extension? if yes, I think we can only inject an SError, but can not change its ESR value, because it does not have vsesr_el2.

yes, we may need to support user-space injects an SError even through CPU does not have RAS Extension.

sure, we should. Last week, I checked the KVM_GET/SET_VCPU_EVENTS IOCTL, it should meet our migration requirements

Got it.

Thanks for the reminder, I know your meaning.
In the x86, the kvm_vcpu_events includes exception/interrupt/nmi/smi. For the RAS, we
only involves the exception, so Qemu handling logic is different. Anyway, I will try to
share code for the two platform in Qemu.


/* for KVM_GET/SET_VCPU_EVENTS */
struct kvm_vcpu_events {
	struct {
		__u8 injected;
		__u8 nr;
		__u8 has_error_code;
		__u8 pad;
		__u32 error_code;
	} exception;
	struct {
		__u8 injected;
		__u8 nr;
		__u8 soft;
		__u8 shadow;
	} interrupt;
	struct {
		__u8 injected;
		__u8 pending;
		__u8 masked;
		__u8 pad;
	} nmi;
	__u32 sipi_vector;
	__u32 flags;
	struct {
		__u8 smm;
		__u8 pending;
		__u8 smm_inside_nmi;
		__u8 latched_init;
	} smi;
	__u32 reserved[9];
};

yes, I will, thanks for your kind suggestion.
