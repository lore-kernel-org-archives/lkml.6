Is this going to break any systems that were previous setting PYTHON?

I like this change, and feel it is the correct thing to do, but having a
"fallback" might be needed here.

Could you do what the perf makefile does and do something like:
	override PYTHON := $(call get-executable-or-default,PYTHON,$(PYTHON2))
or is it really not an issue as only ia64 seems to care about this?

thanks,
