This one had various issues.  I've fixed most of what I saw and staged
in linux-next (purely for build test coverage purposes).  I may drop
this patch if others disagree with it (or my sg deallocation in the
error path question isn't answered).

I've staged the changes here (and in linux-next via 'for-next'):
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/device-mapper/linux-dm.git/log/?h=dm-4.17

I switched all the new GFP_KERNEL uses to GFP_NOIO.  The fact that
you're doing allocations at all (per IO) is bad enough.  Using
GFP_KERNEL is a serious liability (risk of deadlock if dm-verity were to
be used for something like.. swap.. weird setup but possible).

But the gfp flags aside, the need for additional memory and the
expectation of scalable async parallel IO is potentially at odds with
changes like this (that I just staged, and had to rebase your 2 patches
ontop of):
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/device-mapper/linux-dm.git/commit/?h=dm-4.17&id=a89f6a2cfec86fba7a115642ff082cb4e9450ea6

So I'm particulalry interested to hear from google folks to understand
if they are OK with your proposed verity async crypto API use.

Mike
