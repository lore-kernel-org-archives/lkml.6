To get some more numbers I analyzed some typical rootfs here. It has:

16137 data nodes with total size 41802586
uncompressed data size:          62380950
2116 inode nodes with total size   347042
2115 dent nodes with total size    148790
2911 idx nodes with total size     547068
Total number of branches: 23278

With a SHA256 per branch this would add another 744896 bytes or 1.7%
overhead to the image (1.1% if using the uncompressed data size as base).

I mean that before we can use the "DENT Node" in the picture above we
also have to verify the "INO Node". To get there, we also have to verify
the unrelated "Index Node #2". so in reality we have to verify
seven unrelated leaf nodes and another seven unrelated nodes per tree
level before we can use a node. When changing nodes we have to make sure
all the unrelated nodes stay in memory or we have to read them back from
the device. Of course, some of the unrelated nodes will be used anyway
in the next few moments, nevertheless I can imagine we pay a significant
performance penalty for this.
read/write throughput is another very precious resource on embedded
systems ;)
