Hum, right. So for each IO we have to remove the page from LRU on submit
and then put it back on IO completion (which is going to race with new
submits so LRU lock contention might be an issue). Spending 500 us on that
is not unthinkable when the lock is contended but it is more expensive than
I'd have thought. John, could you perhaps profile where the time is spent?
