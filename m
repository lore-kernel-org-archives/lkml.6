Sure.  I also understand that reading inside a lock and operating on the
value outside the lock isn't really the definition of synchronization
(doesn't really matter in this case though).

I was just suggesting that the implicit memory barrier in the spin unlock
that we are already paying for would be sufficient here too, and it matches
the semantic of "tx fields under tx_lock."  On the other hand, maybe it's
just me, but I tend to look askance at just-in-case READ_ONCEs sprinkled
about.
