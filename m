Subject: [PATCH 00/36] Devicetree schema

The current DT binding documentation is not ideal as it is just free form
text with at most only a loose structure. This makes reviewing bindings a
manual process. The bindings are often duplicating information that's
already defined elsewhere and missing information one would need to
validate a DTS file. The examples in binding documents are not built and
a source of lots of typos sometimes found in review and sometimes not.
Secondly, there's no verification that DTS files match what the
documentation says. While dtc does do some checking (and has gained more
recently), it can't do per binding checks as it would have to understand
thousands of compatible strings to match on.

There's been a number of proposals over the years to address validation.
They've all suffered from inventing their own validation language and the
effort it would take to fully define and flush out a validation language.
Enter json-schema. The language has a defined specification, maps well to
DT data, and there are numerous existing tools which can be leveraged.
The actual DT schema doc files are stored as YAML using only a JSON
compatible subset. YAML is considered more human readable allowing
comments for example.

This series adds the build support, some documentation, and converts
some bindings (mostly ARM board/soc bindings). The tools, core schema,
and meta-schema are in a separate repository[1]. This might eventually
be integrated with dtc or added to the kernel, but for now I plan to
keep it separate.

Future plans/ideas:
- Validate examples against the schema. Currently, they are just built
  with dtc.
- Support single targets in addition to validating all enabled dtb
  targets.
- Better control of which schemas to use for validation such as core
  only or specific lists of schemas. This will make for more easily
  testing new schema and filtering warnings.
- Printing out nodes without any specific schema (i.e. missing schema).

This series is dependent on the dt/next branch and is available here[2].
The branch also has a doc2yaml script which can help convert binding
files. It's not perfect, but works pretty well considering the input is
free form text.
