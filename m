Again, I never said I didn't want these changes.  I just thought it
worthwhile to mention the potential for alignment quirks arising.

Reality is false sharing is quite uncommon.  So my concern was/is pretty
niche and unlikely to be applicable.

That said, I did take the opportunity to look at all the DM structures
that were modified.  The bio_set and mempool_t structs are so large that
they span multiple cachelines as is.  So I focused on eliminating
unnecessary spanning of cachelines (by non-bio_set and non-mempool_t
members) and eliminated most holes in DM structs.  This is the result:
http://people.redhat.com/msnitzer/dm-4.18-struct-reorg/

Compare before.txt vs after_kent.txt vs after_mike.txt

Nothing staggering or special.  Just something I'll add once Kent's
latest changes land.

But, I also eliminated 2 4-byte holes in struct bio_set, Jens please
feel free to pick this up (if you think it useful):
