Hi,

Thanks!

Right, I intentionally omitted the volatile qualifier here.

Adding it to the definitions from asm-generic/iomap.h would require to
also update lib/iomap.c and arch/ implementations. This should, imo, only
be done if really necessary.

From what I've seen, almost all ioread() implementations simply redirect
to readl style accessors. I could not find one implementation that does
something with the addr argument which requires the volatile qualifier.

Also, I'm not even sure to understand why we need the volatile qualifier
in the ioread() definitions from asm-generic/io.h...

Drivers wishing to pass volatile pointers to ioread() should probably use
a more low level api.

regards,
 Hugo
