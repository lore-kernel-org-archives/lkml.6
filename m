Hi Arend,
I appreciate your response. In my opinion, it has nothing to do with
SDIO host, because it defines "quirks" in the driver itself.
If I get it right, you mean something like this:

mmc3: mmc@1c12000 {
...
        broken-sg-support;
        sd-head-align = 4;
        sd-sgentry-align = 512;

        brcmf: wifi@1 {
                ...
        };
};

Where dt: bindings documentation for these entries should reside?
In generic MMC bindings? Well, this is the very special case and
mmc-linux maintainer will unlikely to accept these changes.
Also, extra kernel code modification might be required. It could make
quite trivial change much more complex.

>Also I am not sure if the broken-sg-support is still needed. We added that for omap_hsmmc, but that has since changed to scatter-gather emulation so it might not be needed anymore.

I've experienced the problem with rk3288 (dw-mmc host) and sdio
settings like above solved it.
Frankly, I haven't investigated any deeper which one of the settings
helped in my case yet...
I will try to get rid of broken-sg-support first and let you know if
it does make any difference.

All the best,
  Alex.
