I've had the same problem on several of my test systems.  Are you sure
it's not this bug report:

https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=912087

?

The solution for me was to install the haveged package which does
active entropy gathering during boot and can make /dev/urandom
available much earlier.

I think the reason for this is that the block mq path doesn't feed the
kernel entropy pool correctly, hence the need to install an entropy
gatherer for systems that don't have other good random number sources.
