The big issue that bothers me isn't the x86-ism so much as the nasty
interactions with the optimizer.  On x86, we have all of this working.
It's in arch/x86/include/asm/paravirt_types.h, and it looks roughly
like:

                        asm volatile(pre                                \
                                     paravirt_alt(PARAVIRT_CALL)        \
                                     post                               \
                                     : call_clbr, ASM_CALL_CONSTRAINT   \
                                     : paravirt_type(op),               \
                                       paravirt_clobber(clbr),          \
                                       ##__VA_ARGS__                    \
                                     : "memory", "cc" extra_clbr);      \

With some extra magic for the constraints.  And I don't even think
this is strictly correct -- from very recent experience, telling the
compiler that "memory" is clobbered and that a bunch of arguments are
used as numeric inputs may not actually imply that the asm modifies
the target of pointer arguments.  Checks this lovely bug out:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/luto/linux.git/commit/?h=3D=
x86/vdso-tglx&id=3D715bd9d12f84d8f5cc8ad21d888f9bc304a8eb0b

As far as I can tell, the whole PVOP infrastructure has the same bug.
And I don't see how to avoid it generically on x86 or any other
architecture.  (PeterZ, am I wrong?  Are we really just getting lucky
that x86 pvop calls actually work?  Or do we not have enough of them
that take pointers as arguments for this to matter?)

Plus, asm volatile ( ..., "memory" ) is a barrier and makes code
generation suck.

Whereas, if we use my suggestion the semantics are precisely those of
any other C function call because, as far as GCC is concerned, it *is*
a C function call.  So the generated code *is* a function call.
