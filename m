Yes, MT7622 has the type 1 config header and related bridge windows and
primary/secondary/subordinate bus numbers.

Thanks for explain this.
Yes, the MT7622 bridge needs its memory window to be configured but I
prefer the PCI resource core to do this for the following reasons:
1. MTK have MT7622 and MT2712, they pretty much using the same IP, but
have different memory window base. Currently we using device tree to
pass the memory window base. Take using of PCI resource core code to
parse and assign those resource will release the burden of driver.
2. I do not want to re-implement the resource parse code to get the
memory base from device node. And hard code the memory base in driver is
not quite elegant.
3. Most of the host driver which I referenced are using the PCI resource
core to help with it's memory window configure, I guess following the
majority way maybe better even they may have slit different of the IP
design from MTK.
4. Passing the memory base in device node make it more flexible to
change the memory window base (in the HW acceptable range) in case of
some special EP device required some special PCI address range.
5. MT7622 and MT2712 have the pretty much same IP only MT7622's HW has
set the class type to an un-proper class type. Set it to the same values
as MT2712 is an easy way to fix.

thanks.

I will update the commit message (put some of the above reasons in the
commit message) and send a new version of this patch if it's acceptable
for you.
