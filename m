Subject: [PATCH v5 02/12] KVM: arm/arm64: Document KVM_VGIC_V3_ADDR_TYPE_REDIST_REGION

We introduce a new KVM_VGIC_V3_ADDR_TYPE_REDIST_REGION attribute in
KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_GRP_ADDR group. It allows userspace to provide the
base address and size of a redistributor region

Compared to KVM_VGIC_V3_ADDR_TYPE_REDIST, this new attribute allows
to declare several separate redistributor regions.

So the whole redist space does not need to be contiguous anymore.
