Ah! This is where it came from. Sorry, this was just to illustrate the
information/sizes we wanted to transfer.... I didn't mean it literally.

I should have said "64 bits of ESR, so that we can transfer anything that is
added to VSESR_EL2 in the future, a flag somewhere to indicate an serror is
pending, and another flag to indicate the ESR has a value we should use".


Thanks/Sorry!

James
