The only problem is the handlful of places like proc/fd and binder that
call get_files_struct then put_files_struct.  So the count on the files
struct may be artificually elevated.

Which actually means there is a race and if someone opens files in
/proc/<execing pid>/fd at the right moment unshare_files may even
unshare_files for a single threaded process.

It looks like struct file_table has 32 bytes of padding on any
architecture with 64byte cache lines.  So with care I believe you can
avoid growing struct file_table.

The cookie would needs to be a pointer because it is stored in the same
space as other pointers so it needs to disambiguate between pointers.
Plus the cookie would need a reference count, as multiple instances
of struct file_table could point to it.

Thinking about it I am not a fan of the cooking solution or of the
moving the owner solution because when two processes share a file_table
it changes which process owns the locks from the fdtable after exec.
Currently it is the process that doesn't exec.


Separating counting down for task_structs and users of get_files_struct
would seem to be a straight forward solution to the possibility of
overcounts.


Ignoring backwards compatibily.  I would argue that the proper solution
is to remove unshare_files completely.  Do what we do with the fs_struct
in check_unsafe_exec and simply set LSM_UNSAFE_UNSHARE if we are sharing
the files struct with anything other than a thread.

That said we do have backwards compatibility to worry about, and there
is the weirdness of a process which does not exec having file
descriptors close in their file table.  So I do think it is best
to unshare the file descriptor table.


The only file descriptor I have find that in the exec code path is the
file descriptor that is passed into exec.  So I don't think races with
file descriptors are a reason to be doing unshare_files early.

The only race I can think of that might be worth considering is what
happens if one thread calls clone(CLONE_FILES) while we are calling
exec.  The clone(CLONE_FS) case prevents that race by returning
-EAGAIN from clone if fs->in_exec is set.  So there is a known
path for handling that race.



I think the way I would fix the issue is:
- Use a different counter on file_table for get_files_struct than for
  threads.  Solving the miscount issue.
- Protect the thread_counter in struct file_table with files_lock.
- Add an in_exec field in struct file_table.
- Cause clone(CLONE_FILES) to fail if in_exec is set.
- Write the code to see if file_table is shared beyond a single process
  in a race free way.
- Set in_exec if the file_table is not shared between processes.
- Unshare the fd table if the fd table is shared between processes.


To help understand what is going on and why I dug through the history
and found a couple of key commits that pretty much say when and why
things are happening.  Some of them come from tglx's history tree so you
need to look there for the earlier commits.

Author: Miklos Szeredi <miklos@szeredi.hu>

    [PATCH] remove steal_locks()
    
    This patch removes the steal_locks() function.
    
    steal_locks() doesn't work correctly with any filesystem that does it's own
    lock management, including NFS, CIFS, etc.
    
    In addition it has weird semantics on local filesystems in case tasks
    sharing file-descriptor tables are doing POSIX locking operations in
    parallel to execve().
    
    The steal_locks() function has an effect on applications doing:
    
    clone(CLONE_FILES)
      /* in child */
      lock
      execve
      lock
    
    POSIX locks acquired before execve (by "child", "parent" or any further
    task sharing files_struct) will after the execve be owned exclusively by
    "child".
    
    According to Chris Wright some LSB/LTP kind of suite triggers without the
    stealing behavior, but there's no known real-world application that would
    also fail.
    
    Apps using NPTL are not affected, since all other threads are killed before
    execve.
    
    Apps using LinuxThreads are only affected if they
    
      - have multiple threads during exec (LinuxThreads doesn't kill other
        threads, the app may do it with pthread_kill_other_threads_np())
      - rely on POSIX locks being inherited across exec
    
    Both conditions are documented, but not their interaction.
    
    Apps using clone() natively are affected if they
    
      - use clone(CLONE_FILES)
      - rely on POSIX locks being inherited across exec
    
    The above scenarios are unlikely, but possible.
    
    If the patch is vetoed, there's a plan B, that involves mostly keeping the
    weird stealing semantics, but changing the way lock ownership is handled so
    that network and local filesystems work consistently.
    
    That would add more complexity though, so this solution seems to be
    preferred by most people.

    [PATCH] sanitize handling of shared descriptor tables in failing execve()
    
    * unshare_files() can fail; doing it after irreversible actions is wrong
      and de_thread() is certainly irreversible.
    * since we do it unconditionally anyway, we might as well do it in do_execve()
      and save ourselves the PITA in binfmt handlers, etc.
    * while we are at it, binfmt_som actually leaked files_struct on failure.
    
    As a side benefit, unshare_files(), put_files_struct() and reset_files_struct()
    become unexported.
