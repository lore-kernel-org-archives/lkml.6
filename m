Sorry, I should have pulled in these new CC's earlier because ppc and
s390 both have PCI error handling similar to what Oza is changing
here.

The basic issue is that the new PCIe DPC (Downstream Port Containment,
see PCIe r4.0, sec 6.2.10) feature doesn't fit very well in the
framework of the pci_error_handlers callbacks.

When DPC is enabled, a Downstream Port (either a Root Port or a Switch
Downstream Port) that receives an ERR_FATAL message automatically
disables its Link.  IIUC, this is also intended for use in hot-unplug
scenarios.

When the DPC hardware takes the Link down, it resets all the
downstream devices, and there's not much point in calling the
pci_error_handlers callbacks because the devices are unreachable.
Even after the Link comes back up, we can't be certain the same device
is there because of the hotplug possibility.

The software side of DPC recovery basically consists of detaching the
drivers of the downstream devices (calling their .remove() methods),
bringing the link back up, re-enumerating the downstream devices, and
re-attaching the drivers (calling their .probe() methods).

The existing AER code also responds to ERR_FATAL messages, but it does
call the pci_error_handlers callbacks and also resets the link.

This is a bit of a mess because things look a lot different to the
driver depending on whether the platform supports AER or DPC.

Since we can't change the way DPC works, the idea of this series is
basically to make AER handle ERR_FATAL more like DPC does, i.e., by
resetting the link, detaching, and re-attaching the drivers.

This series is currently on my pci/aer branch
(https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/helgaas/pci.git/log/?h=pci/aer)
and is headed for v4.18 unless somebody raises major objections.

I applied this series with a trivial change to remove an unused variable to
pci/aer for v4.18, thanks!
