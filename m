gcc also benefits massively, up to 2x or more performance improvement
from ILP32, just because you can double your -jN to make. The "or
more" comes from cache utilization also improving. Actually I often
use i486 gcc even on 64-bit systems for this reason, and have observed
this order of improvement despite the lack of registers and worse call
ABI. Presumably x32 would be better, but I've avoided it because of
how buggy it's been in the past.

I would not classify any of that as part of "removing x32 support",
but rather as "reintroducing broken assumptions". I think "removing
x32 support" was intended to mean places where there's
explicitly-x32-specific code or tooling, like asm functions/fragments
in libc, x32 versions of the dispatch asm in mesa, x32 code
generation, etc. Obviously (at least I hope it's obvious) nonportable
assumptions should not be reintroduced regardless of whether x32 is
dropped.

FWIW x32 is nice as a test case for catching such nonportable
assumptions and getting them fixed.
