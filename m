Hi Marc,

Sorry we broke this!

But a non-ACPI system *should* be able to use SHPC.

Here's my understanding of how it should work.  On an ACPI system,

  - If firmware has _OSC, the OS calls it to request permission to
    manage the SHPC.  If _OSC grants permission, it should also
    configure the hardware (interrupts, etc) to give the OS.
    
  - If there's no _OSC, shpchp assumes it's allowed to manage the
    SHPC, and it calls OSHP to configure the hardware appropriately.

On a non-ACPI system, shpchp assumes there's no firmware involved at
all, so it can manage the SHPC without doing anything special.

I see Mika has already posted a patch similar to the first one
below; I think either of those should fix the problem you're seeing.

The second is an attempt to clean things up so they make a
little more sense.

Bjorn

    PCI: shpchp: Manage SHPC unconditionally on non-ACPI systems
    
    If CONFIG_ACPI=y but the current hardware/firmware platform doesn't support
    ACPI, acpi_get_hp_hw_control_from_firmware() is implemented and causes a
    NULL pointer dereference  because acpi_pci_find_root() returns NULL.
    
    If acpi_pci_find_root() returns NULL, it means there's no ACPI host bridge
    device (PNP0A03 or PNP0A08), and the OS is always allowed to manage the
    SHPC, so return success in that case.

    PCI: shpchp: Separate existence of SHPC and permission to use it
    
    The shpchp driver registers for all PCI bridge devices.  Its probe method
    should fail if either (1) the bridge doesn't have an SHPC or (2) the OS
    isn't allowed to use it.
    
    Separate these two tests into:
    
      - A new shpc_capable() that looks for the SHPC hardware and is applicable
        on all systems, and
    
      - A simplified acpi_get_hp_hw_control_from_firmware() that we call only
        when we already know an SHPC exists and there may be ACPI methods to
        either request permission to use it (_OSC) or transfer control to the
        OS (OSHP).
