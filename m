This is changing. See "RFC on writel and writel_relaxed" thread. PowerPC 
maintainers are looking for a way to implement this.

What matters is the description in the barriers document. See also 
section "MMIO access primitives" here about mmiowb()

This can be a compiler barrier for some arches and/or can be architecturally 
guaranteed as in ARM64's device nGnRE mapping (non-gathering non-reordering with
early acknowledgment).

Both writel() and writel_relaxed() need to guarantee ordering with respect to
what HW observes for writes. 

They have different guarantees regarding the code surrounding write like you
identified.

makes sense
