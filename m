So since this is going to be a lot of commits I'd rather not edit every title, but 
every single patch you sent has a non-standard title that looks totally out of 
place if you look at existing commits to those same files.

For example:

>   x86: boot, annotate local functions

Modifies files whose existing commit title format to be:

974f221c84b0: x86/boot: Move compressed kernel to the end of the decompression buffer
c04028813221: x86/boot: Clarify purpose of functions in misc.c

So could you please use the proper x86 titles?

In fact I'd suggest using the same subsystem identifier for most patches, i.e.:

   x86/asm: Annotate xen-pvh symbols ....

because these are really mostly assembly code annotations.

Thanks,

	Ingo
