Ok, I'm fine with this, so applied and queued up for -stable.

I will note in passing that there are several 32-bit architectures
that have 64-bit loads.  Sparc is one such case.  And they would not
need these changes.

But I don't think it's practical or worthwhile to add that level of
consideration into your changes.  I'd rather the commit stay as simple
as possible.

Thanks!
