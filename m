Yes I like that much better.

I understand why you would want it by debugging, but I think it does
make more sense to be included with the above two other options, as
they are all mutually exclusive.

This brings up the topic of creating config paradigms. That is, a way
of saying "I want a debug kernel" and select one option that selects
everything you would expect. Or perhaps we should have a:

 make debug_config

that does it.

But that's a different topic. For now, I would just included it in
init/Kconfig, and not worry about it not showing up in kernel hacking.
