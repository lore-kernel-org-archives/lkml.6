It doesn't depend on any PCIe feature in particular, but we don't need to do it
for PCI-to-PCI bridges in general.

The reason why we need this is related to deep low-power states on new
SoCs that only can be entered if PCIe root ports are in D3 (that is, if the
root ports are not in D3, the whole SoC cannot enter some of its deep
low-power states and that may exted to package C-states for processors).

That also is the reason why we do it for PCIe only.

The reason for the cut-off date is because we know it for a fact that PCIe
port PM doesn't work on some older platforms due to hardware issues and,
again, it only really needs to be done on recent SoCs.

I believe that all of the above was mentioned during discussions on the patches
that ended up as commit 9d26d3a8f1b0 and so on.

Right, but in some cases we access config spaces for things like PME
status changes and similar (and AML may be accessing them too for similar
reasons) and if the request is dropped on the floor silently then, well,
so be it.

Not necessarily.

Say, user space may want to access it too via the bus type's sysfs.

That's why we have pci_config_pm_runtime_get(), for instance.

The core may do accesses like that IMO (especially reads, not writes), but
indeed this particular case looks a bit over the top.

Right.

Generally speaking, every code path going directly to the config space
(below the driver) needs to take the possibility that the device may be in
D3cold into account.

Whether or not this means resuming the device upfront depends on the purpose
of the access I think.
