I must say I'm impressed. Very nice arithmetics going on there.

If I can get some ACK for the bitops patch I'd be happy to merge
it all through the GPIO tree. The users are pretty clear cut.

BTW: if I could, I would pull out Donald Knuth's "The Art of Computer
Programming vol 4A" chapter 7.1.3 "Bitwise Tricks and Techniques"
to see what he has to say about the subject, but I don't have
that book as it turns out.

Yours,
