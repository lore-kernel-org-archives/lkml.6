Right.

But AFAICS config space reads from devices that aren't there (which
effectively is what happens if the bridge is in D3hot) are at least
expected to return all ones.

I'm not sure what the question is to be honest.

Unused ports are autosuspended after 100ms as per pcie_portdrv_probe().

Now, it looks like they should be resumed in the code path in question,
so this case seems to have been overlooked.

Mika, what do you think?
