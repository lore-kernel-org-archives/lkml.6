I expected nothing less from you! ;-)

I just implemented it, and this is indeed much better. In most cases,
the store gets optimized away, mostly because we either pass NULL (and
the condition is dropped) or the store doesn't need to take place as we
evaluate a condition and discard the structure, like in
check_smccc_arch_workaround_1.

In all cases, this allows for slightly reduced levels of cpp madness,
and better codegen. I also suspect it will solve Ard's register
allocation issue.

Thanks,
