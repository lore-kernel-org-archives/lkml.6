The function does the following:

	ioc_state = mpt3sas_base_get_iocstate(ioc, 0);
	if ((ioc_state & MPI2_IOC_STATE_MASK) != MPI2_IOC_STATE_OPERATIONAL)
		return;

where MPI2_IOC_STATE_MASK is 0xF0000000 and MPI2_IOC_STATE_OPERATIONAL
is 0x20000000.  If the device is removed after the call to
mpt3sas_base_pci_device_is_available(), the result of the bitwise "and"
operation would be 0xF0000000, which is unequal to 0x20000000.
Hence this looks safe.

I agree that pci_device_is_present() (and the pci_dev_is_disconnected()
it calls) must be used judiciously, but here it seems to have been done
correctly.

One thing to be aware of is that a return value of "true" from
pci_dev_is_disconnected() is definitive and can be trusted.
On the other hand a return value of "false" is more like a fuzzy
"likely not disconnected, but can't give any guarantees".
So the boolean return value is kind of the problem here.
Boolean logic doesn't really fit these "definitive if true,
not definitive if false" semantics.

However being able to get the definitive answer in the disconnected
case is valuable:  pciehp is the only entity that can determine
surprise removal authoritatively and unambiguously (albeit with
a latency).  All the other tools that we have at our disposal don't
have that quality:  E.g. checking the Vendor ID is ambiguous because
it returns a valid value if a device was quickly replaced with another
one.  Also, all ones may be returned in the case of an Uncorrectable
Error, but the device may revert to valid responses if the error can
be recovered.  (Please correct me if I'm wrong.)

Thanks,

Lukas
