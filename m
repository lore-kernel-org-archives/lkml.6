Nice-looking code.

It's a shame that it doesn't actually dercease the kernel line count,
but there are other benefits.

The patches are missing the hoped-for acks, but I think you maintain
most/all of those drivers.

Do we have any expectation that these facilities will be used by
anything other than GPIO?  If not then perhaps they should be sited
within drivers/gpio (presumably as a standalone module) until such a
need is found?
