Fine; then *say that*.  I also see Michal saying "No" a lot.  Sometimes
I agree with him, sometimes I don't.  I think he genuinely wants the best
code in the kernel, and saying "No" is part of it.

> He didn't want to fix vmalloc(GFP_NOIO)

I don't remember that conversation, so I don't know whether I agree with
his reasoning or not.  But we are supposed to be moving away from GFP_NOIO
towards marking regions with memalloc_noio_save() / restore.  If you do
that, you won't need vmalloc(GFP_NOIO).

The GFP flags are a mess, still.

No, you should reserve calling somebody evil for truly evil things.

... that also doesn't make somebody evil.

Yes, and I think that's the right idea.  So send a v2 and ignore the
replies that are clearly relating to an earlier version of the patch.
Not everybody reads every mail in the thread before responding to one they
find interesting.  Yes, ideally, one would, but sometimes one doesn't.
