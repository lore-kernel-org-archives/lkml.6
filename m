Arguably, however, we are on the receiving end of things here and even if
we don't use this binding, that won't buy us anything (but it will introduce
a fair amount of disappointment among both users and OEMs).

If Windows uses it, then systems will ship with it regardless of what Linux
does with it, so your "acquiescing to what has been done" argument leads to
nowhere in this particular case.  It's just a matter of whether or not
Linux will provide the same level of functionality as Windows with respect
to this and IMO it would be impractical to refuse to do that for purely
formal reasons.

For the record, my opinion is that there's a little choice on whether or not
to use this extra information that firmware is willing to give us.  It could
be defined in a better way and so on, but since it is in use anyway, we really
have nothing to gain by refusing to use it.

Now, where the handling of it belongs to is a separate matter that should be
decided on its own.

Thanks,
Rafael
