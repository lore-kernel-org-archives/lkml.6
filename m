Me neither. I'm just trying to discuss the problem lurking behind
these partitions.

Yep.

Yeah I saw that as well... it's a bit funny.

But this patch doesn't hide the partition from userspace does it?

They will still appear in /dev/mmcblk0boot1 etc.

Just not reported as "real" partitions in /proc/partitions.

Or do I misunderstand it?

I think we should, but we have the problem with the boot partitions
and general partitions that they do not work anything like SCSCI
LUNs.

On a SCSI device dd from the whole device will copy all data on
the device, the partition table and contents of all partitions.

For say /dev/mmcblk0 this is not true of the device contains
boot or general partitions, those other partitions will not be
copied.
