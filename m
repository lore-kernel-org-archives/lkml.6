Ugh.  Should have read the code first before replying:

         /* Do we need to assign a pkey for mm's execute-only maps? */
         if (execute_only_pkey == -1) {
                 /* Go allocate one to use, which might fail */
                 execute_only_pkey = mm_pkey_alloc(mm);
                 if (execute_only_pkey < 0)
                         return -1;
                 need_to_set_mm_pkey = true;
         }

So we do allocate the PROT_EXEC-only key, and I assume it means that the 
key can be restored using pkey_mprotect.  So the key 0 behavior is a 
true exception after all, and it makes sense to realign the behavior 
with the other keys.

Thanks,
Florian
