I see, thanks a lot for relaying this information.  The PCI SIG
should probably consider granting access to specs to open source
developers to ease adoption of new features in Linux et al.

Per table 4-14 and figure 4-23 (immediately below the table) in r4.0,
PDC ought to be signaled before DLLSC.  As said, Linux can handle PDC
after DLLSC if they're not too far apart (100 ms, see pcie_wait_for_link()).

I agree, having support for this new ECN would be great.

If you look at struct controller in drivers/pci/hotplug/pciehp.h,
there's a section labelled /* capabilities and quirks */.  An idea
would be to add an unsigned int there to indicate whether in-band
presence is disabled.  An alternative would be to add a flag to
struct pci_dev.

Instead of modifying the logic in pciehp_handle_presence_or_link_change(),
you could amend pcie_wait_for_link() to poll PDS until it's set, in
addition to DLLLA.  The rationale would be that although the link is up,
the hot-added device cannot really be considered accessible until PDS
is also set.  Unfortunately we cannot do this for all devices because
(as I've said before), some broken devices hardwire PDS to zero.  But
it should be safe to constrain it to those which can disable in-band
presence.

Be mindful however that pcie_wait_for_link() is also called from the
DPC driver.  Keith should be able to judge whether a change to that
function breaks DPC.

You'll probably also need to add code to disable in-band presence if
that is supported, either in pcie_init() in pciehp_hpc.c or in generic
PCI code.

Thanks,

Lukas
