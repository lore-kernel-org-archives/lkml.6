The idea is actually to try to change this for all host drivers, of
course it's only for this particular CMD6 in question, so not for all
CMD6.

However, before we consider doing such a change, we need to know if it
solves the problem for you? If it doesn't, then we can drop the idea.

As a perhaps better alternative, Adrian also suggested, if possible,
to let the mediatek driver change to "fixed sampling mode" via the
->set_ios() host ops, at the point when the clk rate drops to
HS-frequency, but still running with MMC_TIMING_MMC_HS400 timings. Of
course this means "fixed sampling" needs to be supported by the
mediatek IP.

If neither of this works for you, we need to consider something else.

[...]
