Fair enough :)

Agreed, I think my more recent e-mail does a much better job of laying out
the issues we're seeing here.

That was the 0/2 mail in the patch series. Here are the next two, which
contain the actual patches:

https://marc.info/?l=linux-btrfs&m=130532892525016&w=2
https://marc.info/?l=linux-btrfs&m=130532899325091&w=2

Keep in mind that the patch has evolved since then though it's essentially
the same idea - use a callback where we need to get the correct device.

Awesome, thanks for the link Amir.

Ahh yeah so in that case we could have the mark on the fs_view instead of
the superblock and you'd deref it from the inode to get to that inodes root.
