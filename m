At least I'm not aware of such an option. Windows for example enables
IOMMU for everything and I think macOS does the same. In Linux (with
these patches) we put all internal devices already passthrough mode so
things like internal graphics should not be affected. eGPUs are
different thing, though.

Thanks for clarifying :)

Yes, we may want to add a way enable ATS for external devices (perhaps
global option or per-device attribute) if it turns out to cause
performance issues. However, I think it can be done later if needed. I
have not seen a single device actually supporting ATS (with the
exception of the "hacked" one in the linked thesis of patch 3/4 ;-))
