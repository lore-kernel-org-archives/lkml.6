This is true for all the architectures supported by the Linux kernel.  
However, in the future it might not always hold.  I can imagine that
CPU designers would want to include an optimization that checks a
conditional branch to see if it skips over only the following
instruction (and the following instruction can't affect the flow of
control); in that situation, they might decide there doesn't need to be
a control dependency to future stores.  Such an optimization would not
violate the C11 memory model.

Of course, this is purely theoretical.  And if anybody does decide to
try doing that, the memory-model people might scream at them so hard
they change their minds.  :-)

In more detail, herd analyzes the source code and constructs a set of
all possible candidate executions.  herd then checks each execution to
see if it violates the rules of the memory model as expressed in the
.bell and .cat files.  If any of the non-violating executions satisfies
the litmus test's final "exists" condition, herd reports that the test
is allowed.

The point here is that when herd checks any one particular execution, 
it pays attention _only_ to the statements which are part of that 
execution.  Statements belonging to an untaken "if" branch are ignored 
completely.  That's why I think it would be difficult to make herd do 
exactly what we want in this case.
