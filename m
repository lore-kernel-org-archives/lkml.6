Fine with using a dma API always on the Linux side, but we do want to
special case virtio still at the arch and qemu side to have a "direct
mapping" mode. Not sure how (special flags on PCI devices) to avoid
actually going through an emulated IOMMU on the qemu side, because that
slows things down, esp. with vhost.

IE, we can't I think just treat it the same as a physical device.

Cheers,
Ben.
