I tried to reproduce this issue on Apalis iMX6 (i.MX 6Q) with a ath9k
PCIe WiFi card, the issue you are seeing did not happen. My lspci looks
as follows:

I did also setup a WiFi network and transmitted some packages, but I did
not get a nobody carred message. Do you have an idea why that might be?

# cat /proc/interrupts
...
312:      10967          0          0          0       GPC 123 Level    
ath9k
...


Your conclusion in this thread seem reasonable, hence reverting the
issue does. However, I still would like to reproduce the issue so I can
make sure that future patches don't break it :-)
