I do not want to merge new code with known issues, it makes no sense.

There are other drivers with a similar problem in the mainline, we
ought to fix those but certainly adding more won't help in that respect.

There is nothing I am saying here that goes against your work, I just
want to have working code in the mainlike kernel, we will merge this
series when it is ready, thanks for bearing with me.

Feel free to ping me/rebase/repost when dependencies are sorted.

Thanks,
Lorenzo
