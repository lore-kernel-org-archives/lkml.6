For cp (coreutils), apparently there was a concern that copy_file_range()
expands holes; see the thread at
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2016-09/msg00020.html.
Though, I'd think it could just be used on non-holes only.  And I don't think
the size_t type of 'len' is a problem either, since it's the copy length, not
the file size.  You just call it multiple times if the file is larger.
