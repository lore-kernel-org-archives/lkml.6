Good point, but maybe that just means we should be setting it in

I think only ixgbe behaves this way between the two, igb disables sriov
in its remove function unless we're hung up by that silly
pci_vfs_assigned() check, which doesn't apply to vfio assignment.
Regardless, yes, some pf drivers do leave sriov enabled on remove,
whether that's useful or reasonable is another question.

Nope, sriov does not appear to be part of the device state saved and
restored around reset, so I think we just end up in an inconsistent
state.  Also, vfio-pci stores a copy of the saved state of a device
prior to giving the user access to the device and tries to restore that
copy when released by the user, so anything that's part of the save
state and modified via side-channels while the device is opened, would
still be lost.

Similar, but the pf driver has enabled sriov and can register the
reset_done error handler to be notified to re-enable sriov or perform
other cleanup.  If the pf driver is not participating in sriov, it
would seem exceptional to support this.  Triggering reset via sysfs
also falls more closely to shooting yourself in the foot than I think
we want to design into driver/subsystem APIs.

But we can't simply split vfs and pfs as separate resources, the vf is
dependent on the pf and that implies a privilege hierarchy, if not at
least cooperation.  The pf driver can intentionally or unintentionally
disconnect the vfs at any point in time, possibly leading to data loss
or at least denial of service for the vf consumer.  I also don't trust
that there aren't numerous sriov implementations where the pf isn't
privileged to the point of being able to snoop data from the vf.  So
what sort of usage models are we enabling for the vf?  A firmware owned
vf subject to these conditions seems mostly pointless.

Doesn't guarantee communication or cooperation or even trust.

Is an sriov configuration ever static?  vfio is the most prolific user
of the pci reset interfaces, AFAIK.  Even if we add support for
restoring the sriov configuration and even if the pf user isn't trying
to be malicious, vf users would need to be prepared for their device
arbitrarily dropping off the bus, mmio randomly (from their
perspective) being disabled, and maybe other side-effects of the user
just trying to use the pf device.  Is there even any guarantee that a
pf driver can operate identically, regardless of the state of sriov on
the pf?  It seems like the pf driver needs to be aware of which queues
are available for itself vs the vfs in some designs.  Is there still
long term value in a solution for this if the kernel is tainted?

Minimally, it seems like the pf driver (the user driver, not vfio-pci)
needs to be a cooperating party in this exchange.  How do we determine
that and what QoS guarantees are they providing by agreeing to it?
Otherwise it doesn't seem like sriov provides the sort of static, hard
partitioning of the device that you're asking for.  A vf is a piece of
the pf and we've released ownership and control of the pf to a user.
Thanks,
