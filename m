Yes, that is.

No (because my knowledge of clock internals is poor) but I questioned
the code while reviewing it - I do not think it is a safe assumption
to make (otherwise what's the purpose of having a clk API -
*prepare/unprepare*() - that, AFAIK was implemented to allow back-ends to
block, waiting for an event).

There is clearly an implicit assumption there from clk API caller POW
"this call won't block or an IRQ action - IRQF_NO_SUSPEND - will wake
me up if it does. Or the call can time out, but that's an error path".

This seems fragile to me.

You have a good point, I do not think clk are specials, I am only saying
this patch code can run into significant issues.

That's a very good summary and address my concern, I still question this
patch correctness (and many others that carry out clk operations in S2R
NOIRQ phase), they may work but do not tell me they are rock solid given
your accurate summary above.

Thanks,
