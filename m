I think these registers actually programme the root port register space
in the RC (whether real or fake - that depends on the RC design) so
the class is PCI_CLASS_BRIDGE_PCI, that's what most of host bridge
drivers in drivers/pci/host do.

I would like to get to the bottom of this since it is indeed misleading
(and I do not have HW to test it myself to check my understanding).

Thanks,
Lorenzo
