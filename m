It is the size of the address space we present to the guest. I will update
the documentation to make it more clear.

On a heterogeneous system, the guest could see different values
of PARange on the same VCPU. So that is not safe for a guest at the moment.
Ideally, we should emulate the PARange to provide the system wide safe value, which the
guest can read.

We don't touch the emulation of PARange in the ID registers in this set.
All we do is (in the next patches) limiting the address space size provided
to the guest. May be we could update PARange to the limit imposed and emulate
the field.

It just works as before, creating a 40bit userspace, without any additional
steps. All we do is, allowing to create a VM with bigger address space
by specifying the size in the "type" field. The other question is, does
it really matter what a guest sees in PARange and what it is provided
with ? e.g, on my Juno, the A53's have 40bit and A57 has 44bit, while
the system uses only 40bit.

This will be true even with the new change. i.e, we don't allow a size
beyond the limit supported by all the CPUs on the system.

 From a quick look, the limit comes from cpuid (leaf 0x80000008 ?). So, it
could be via the existing per-VCPU get/set_cpuid{,2}() API on x86.
