Yes, I copied the semantics from Al's patchset. I don't know why he felt
strongly that this was the best idea, but in my opinion allowing paths
like "a/../b/../c" seems like it's quite useful because otherwise you
wouldn't be able to operate on most distribution root filesystems (many
have symlinks that have ".." components). Looking at my own (openSUSE)
machine there are something like 100k such symlinks (~37% of symlinks on
my machine).

While I do understand that the easiest way of solving this problem is to
disallow ".." entirely with AT_BENEATH, given that support ".." has
utility, I would like to know whether it's actually not possible to have
this work safely.

I had another idea since I wrote my previous mail -- since the issue (at
least the way I understand it) is that ".." can "skip" over nd->root
because of the rename, what if we had some sort of is_descendant() check
within follow_dotdot()? (FWIW, ".." already has some pretty interesting
"hand-over-hand" locking semantics.) This should be effectively similar
to how prepend_path() deals with a path that is not reachable from @root
(I'm not sure if the locking is acceptable for the namei path though).

Since ".." with AT_THIS_ROOT (or AT_BENEATH) is not going to be the most
common component type (and we only need to do these checks for those
flags), I would think that the extra cost would not be _that_ awful.

Would this work?

Fair enough, though I believe this would affect most multi-threaded
programs as well (regardless of the language they're written in).
