Yes, forget.

So, "make oldconfig" will ask user preference again
when you switch back to a compiler that provides more capability.
This is not rude, right?




To remember user preference (for both upgrade/downgrade capability),
we need 3 symbols for each feature.

[1] WANT_FOO
    A user can enable this option regardless of compiler capability.
    This will remember your preference forever.

[2] CC_HAS_FOO
    Compiler capability.

[3] FOO
    logical 'and' of WANT_FOO and CC_HAS_FOO.

If we do this way, what's the point of
moving compiler capability tests to Kconfig?


[1] is the same as what we do now.

Then, it will be disabled later
if it turns out unsupported by your compiler.

The only difference is,
whether we calculate [2], [3] in Makefile or Kconfig.

Kconfig is, in the end, inter-symbol dependency/visibility solver.
The WANT_ is not using the benefit of Kconfig.
We can calculate the logical 'and' by other means.





The problem I see in this approach is 'savedefconfig'.

'make defconfig && make savedefconfig'
will produce the subset of user preference and compiler capability.

To make arbitrary set of CONFIG options,
we need a full-featured compiler
in order to enable all CC_HAS_... options.


Maybe, we can add a new environment to ease this.

KCONFIG_SHELL_ALWAYS_TRUE
  If this environment is specified, all 'option shell=...'
  will be evaluated as true.  So, all symbols that depend on
  CC_HAS_  will be visible.   This is useful to make
  arbitrary set of CONFIG options regardless of
  your compiler capability.


$ KCONFIG_SHELL_ALWAYS_TRUE=1  make  menuconfig
   -> build up your favorite config setting

$ KCONFIG_SHELL_ALWAYS_TRUE=1 make savedefconfig
   ->  write out the minimum set of config


Thought?
