OK, so on glibc, the implementation could rely on exit side-effect to
implicitly unregister rseq. On musl, based on the scenario you describe,
the library should unregister rseq explicitly before stack reclaim.

Am I understanding the situation correctly ?

Using a "weak" symbol in early adopter libraries is important, so they
can be loaded together into the same process without causing loader
errors due to many definitions of the same strong symbol.

Using "weak" in a C library is something I'm not sure is a characteristic
we want or need, because I doubt we would ever want to load two libc at the
same time in a given process.

The only reason I see for using "weak" for the __rseq_abi symbol in the
libc is if we want to allow early adopter applications to define
__rseq_abi as a strong symbol, which would make some sense.

Good to know for the musl case.

How hard would it be to create a async-signal-safe memory pool, which would
be always accessed with signals blocked, so we could fix those corner-cases
for good ?
