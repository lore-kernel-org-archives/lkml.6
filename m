This can help the userspace know, what the "default" limit is. As such I am
not particular about keeping this around.

Unfortunately, there is none. We don't expose ID_AA64MMFR0 via mrs emulation.

No. I will take a look. Btw, there were patches flying around to support
"userspace" requesting specific values for ID feature registers. But even that
doesn't help with the detection part. May be that is another way to configure
the size, but not sure about the current status of that work.
