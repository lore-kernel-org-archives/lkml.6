Subject: [PATCH 09/14] Documentation: fpga: move fpga overview to driver-api
Date: Wed, 16 May 2018 18:50:02 -0500

X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.16.2
In-Reply-To: <20180516235007.3951-1-atull@kernel.org>

Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Start of moving Documentation/fpga/*.txt to driver-api, including:
 - Add new directory driver-api/fpga
 - Add new file driver-api/fpga/index.rst
 - Add driver-api/fpga to driver-api/index.rst
 - Move Documentation/fpga/overview.txt to driver-api/fpga/intro.rst
 - Formatting and rewrites so that intro.rst will build cleanly
   and form a good introduction to the rest of the docs to be added.

+Introduction
+============
+
+The FPGA subsystem supports reprogramming FPGAs dynamically under
+Linux.  Some of the core intentions of the FPGA subsystems are:
+
+* The FPGA subsystem is vendor agnostic.
+
+* The FPGA subsystem separates upper layers (userspace interfaces and
+  enumeration) from lower layers that know how to program a specific
+  FPGA.
+
+* Code should not be shared between upper and lower layers.  This
+  should go without saying.  If that seems necessary, there's probably
+  framework functionality that that can be added that will benefit
+  other users.  Write the linux-fpga mailing list and maintainers and
+  seek out a solution that expands the framework for broad reuse.
+
+* Generally, when adding code, think of the future.  Plan for re-use.
+
+The framework in the kernel is divided into:
+
+FPGA Manager
+------------
+
+If you are adding a new FPGA or a new method of programming a FPGA,
+this is the subsystem for you.  Low level FPGA manager drivers contain
+the knowledge of how to program a specific device.  This subsystem
+includes the framework in fpga-mgr.c and the low level drivers that
+are registered with it.
+
+FPGA Bridge
+-----------
+
+FPGA Bridges prevent spurious signals from going out of a FPGA or a
+region of a FPGA during programming.  They are disabled before
+programming begins and re-enabled afterwards.  An FPGA bridge may be
+actual hard hardware that gates a bus to a cpu or a soft ("freeze")
+bridge in FPGA fabric that surrounds a partial reconfiguration region
+of an FPGA.  This subsystem includes fpga-bridge.c and the low level
+drivers that are registered with it.
+
+FPGA Region
+-----------
+
+If you are adding a new interface to the FPGA framework, add it on top
+of a FPGA region to allow the most reuse of your interface.
+
+The FPGA Region framework (fpga-region.c) associates managers and
+bridges as reconfigurable regions.  A region may refer to the whole
+FPGA in full reconfiguration or to a partial reconfiguration region.
+
+The Device Tree FPGA Region support (of-fpga-region.c) handles
+reprogramming FPGAs when device tree overlays are applied.

-Linux kernel FPGA support
-
-Alan Tull 2017
-
-The main point of this project has been to separate the out the upper layers
-that know when to reprogram a FPGA from the lower layers that know how to
-reprogram a specific FPGA device.  The intention is to make this manufacturer
-agnostic, understanding that of course the FPGA images are very device specific
-themselves.
-
-The framework in the kernel includes:
-* low level FPGA manager drivers that know how to program a specific device
-* the fpga-mgr framework they are registered with
-* low level FPGA bridge drivers for hard/soft bridges which are intended to
-  be disable during FPGA programming
-* the fpga-bridge framework they are registered with
-* the fpga-region framework which associates and controls managers and bridges
-  as reconfigurable regions
-* the of-fpga-region support for reprogramming FPGAs when device tree overlays
-  are applied.
-
-I would encourage you the user to add code that creates FPGA regions rather
-that trying to control managers and bridges separately.
