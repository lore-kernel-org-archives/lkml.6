The cgroup interface isn't designed for high update throughput. Changing
cpuset.cpus will require searching for the all the tasks in the cpuset
and change its cpu mask. That isn't a fast operation, but it shouldn't
be too bad either depending on how many tasks are in the cpuset.

I would not suggest doing rapid changes to cpuset.cpus as a mean to tune
the behavior of a task. So what exactly is the tuning you are thinking
about? Is it moving a task from the a high-power cpu to a low power one
or vice versa? If so, it is probably better to move the task from one
cpuset of high-power cpus to another cpuset of low-power cpus.

For v2, if you haven't set up the cpuset.cpus, it defaults to the
effective cpu list of its parent.

cpuset.cpus holds the cpu list written by the users.
cpuset.cpus.effective is the actual cpu mask that is being used. The
effective cpu mask is always a subset of cpuset.cpus. They differ if not
all the CPUs in cpuset.cpus are online.

The behavior of CPU offline event should be similar in v2. Any HP event
will cause the system to reset the cpu masks of task affected by the
event. The online event, however, will be a bit different between v1 and
v2. For v1, the online event won't restore the CPU back to those cpusets
that had the onlined CPU previously. For v2, the v2, the online CPU will
be restored back to those cpusets. So there is less work from the
management layer, but overhead is still there in the kernel of doing the
restore.

For v1, cpuset.cpus.effective is the same as cpuset.cpus unless you turn
on the v2 mode when mounting the v1 cpuset. For v2, they differ. Please
see the explanation above.

Yes, you can control task placement on the thread level, not just process.
