Hi Georgi,

Thanks for testing the patch on 8096 and pointing out this issue.
The issue is coming because, when card is removed, the HOST_CONTROL2 
register is retaining the 1.8V Signalling enable bit till SDHCI reset 
happens after a new card is inserted.

Adding the change you suggested can avoid this wait, but I feel a better 
solution is to clear the 1.8V signalling bit when the card is removed. 
When a new card is inserted, we shouldn't be keeping the 1.8V bit set 
until we send cmd11 to the SD card. A new SD card should start with 3V.

One solution is to explicitly clear the HOST_CONTROL2 register when card 
is removed.

Other way is to revert the commit: 
9718f84b85396e090ca42fafa730410d286d61e3 "mmc: sdhci-msm: Do not reset 
the controller if no card in the slot"

The sdhci-msm doesn't require "SDHCI_QUIRK_NO_CARD_NO_RESET". The issue 
which above commit is trying to avoid is fixed by the pwr-irq patches. 
Resetting the controller will clear the HOST_CONTROL2 register and avoid 
this issue.

Can you please try this ? I tested reverting the QUIRK on two platforms: 
db410c(8916) and sdm845. SD card insert/remove worked fine after that 
and I didn't get any "Reset 0x1 never completed" error during card 
insert/remove or shutdown.

Thanks,
Vijay
