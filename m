Ah, so you may end up needing the dependency trick too, depending on where
you land with the ISA.

You're referring to the string accessors (e.g. insb() and readsw()), right?
arm and arm64 don't provide barriers here either, and I don't think they
should have to given that these routines are usually used to poll data
register-based FIFOs and therefore don't need to provide ordering guarantees
against DMA operations. However, this is woefully undocumented and I shall
try to address this in the next version of my memory-barriers.txt patch
relating to this area [1].

Thanks, Palmer! I'll send a v2 of this patch, updated to fix up insq() as
well as the readX() macros too, since they're likely to suffer the exact
same issues as inX() in this regard.
