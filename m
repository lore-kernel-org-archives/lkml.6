It could, but with the tiny disadvantage of having to allocate static 
storage for it to maintain the "don't bother checking if we want ACS if 
we've already requested it once" logic for multiple root complexes.

I can certainly imagine systems using entirely separate PCI domains for, 
say, expansion slots vs. on-board/on-chip devices, where the former may 
be expected to be assigned to VMs or userspace drivers and the latter 
only ever controlled by the host kernel. Not forcing ACS overhead upon 
the "non-virtualisable" (or "trusted" vs. "untrusted") domain could 
perhaps be beneficial in some cases.

Agreed - without CONFIG_PCI the whole of iort_enable_acs() may as well 
be stubbed out, because it won't achieve anything anyway. The 
implication is that if we have a root complex whose inbound DMA is 
controlled by an SMMU, we should enable ACS to make VFIO useful (or in 
case we want to enforce strict DMA isolation in general), but if Linux 
is never going to touch any PCI devices there's no point even looking at 
the RC node(s). TBH I'm pretty dubious about having IORT at all without 
PCI, but I suppose there could potentially be embedded SoCs which have 
an ITS and platform MSIs, or use an SMMU for their video/display 
subsystem, and for some reason demand ACPI-based firmware.
