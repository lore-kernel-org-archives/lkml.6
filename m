Thanks, this is much better.

Thanks, I will do my homework and figure a way out through this
solution.
Currently port->slot is used in too much place to be removed, I guess I
need to added a new parameter in the port struct to store the of_node
for compare.
I'm not sure which way is better, anyway, let me try the new solution.

thanks.
