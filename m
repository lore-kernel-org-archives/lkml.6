Similar logic I am also using, with 1 exception:
	if REQ_IO_LOW and only 3.3V support, set it for 1.8V .

2 addition:
- if it supports high only and requests low: set it low (this case comes 
when BUS_OFF. At that time, its ok to set it low)
- if it supports low only and requests high: set it low

It doesn't assume about previous setting. Just checks what the 
io_pad_switch value and and what it should be.

Both of out logic works fine. But I feel the one in the patch is neater 
and less lines. Maybe because I am used to it.

 From the memory barrier link:

A write memory barrier is implied by wake_up() and co.  if and only if they
wake something up.  The barrier occurs before the task state is cleared, 
and so
sits between the STORE to indicate the event and the STORE to set 
TASK_RUNNING:
_________________
So, as you said, an mb() is not required after the write to IO PAD in HC 
mem. Will remove it.
If the irq thread is not waking anything up, that means there is no 
state change.

At this point, the regulator information wouldn't be available in 
mmc_host. We are reading regulator information from mmc layer which 
comes after the first power irq check. So we need to call 
sdhci_msm_set_regulator_caps() after sdhci_add_host() is complete, so 
that we don't have to wait for the next power_irq to come to complete 
the io pad settings.
