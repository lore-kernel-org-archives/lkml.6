Correct, this is about FSK, not LoRa. The two usually come together and
I therefore need to propose a way to make also FSK usable.

ERP1 PHY layer appears to be ASK, ERP2 PHY layer is described as FSK.

ERP seems a MAC / Data Link protocol (ERP2 also Network layer) on top of
multiple alternative PHYs.

ASK is amplitude-modulated; FSK is frequency-modulated; 802.15.4 is PSK,
i.e. phase-modulated. Therefore from my view they are unrelated
subsystems [*].

Further, as I stated above, 802.15.4 is being used for 2.4 GHz (for
which I currently don't have any EnOcean hard-MAC transceiver), whereas
I am using FSK on 868 MHz.

The ERP layer is openly described, whereas I have not found a lot about
802.15.4 framing except for the below mentioned commands in ESP3 layer.

The EnOcean Alliance depicts ZigBee:
https://www.enocean.com/technology/radio-technology/
If that is the case, I guess we can end the 802.15.4 discussion here? ;)

No concrete documentation on how BLE is used either.

[*] With the exception that both Nemeus and ST have Sigfox DBPSK
implementations based on FSK transceivers.

This appears to refer to 925 MHz FSK in Japan though, not LoRa.

No. ESP is a serial communication protocol between host and transceiver.
It abstracts the underlying radio protocol. By using SOCK_DGRAM, as
implemented in this patchset, we can pass payload data from userspace
via ESP to ERP. We cannot transmit a full SOCK_RAW ERP frame via ESP though.

My point was that by not implementing a custom PF_ERP2 protocol family
we don't have a place to implement the framing for FSK or 802.15.4
ourselves and rely on the ESP abstraction for now. Or put differently,
userspace will always need to use SOCK_DGRAM for compatibility with ESP,
and each PHY (FSK, 802.15.4, etc.) would need to re-implement framing
that payload.

Window handles are an example type of EnOcean sensor: Turning the handle
is used for energy harvesting to send such a short radio message, which
then needs to be interpreted as "window tilted" and not as "button 2
pressed" or "temperature is 20°C" etc.

> Can this be changed during runtime?

Someone using this patchset can obviously send any data they want and
interpret incoming data any way they want. I don't think commercial
devices do that. But then again I'm not an expert.

The EnOcean Alliance profiles determine the interpretation of the
payload data and status bytes.

Since none of those sensor/actuator devices are likely to run Linux, I
don't think it matters how sensors implement their MCU firmware layers.

This DT example just being a sketch, we might just encode the profile
identifier triple in the compatible string, say "enocean,a5-02-01".
The actual manufacturer and model should then not have much influence.

Each profile could be a separate kernel driver. There's 25 4BS profiles
for temperature sensors, plus 6 profiles for combinations of multiple
sensors (temperature + humidity, light + temperature + occupancy), plus
one VLD profile with three types. The first hex number in the profile
identifier (e.g., A5-02-01) is the transmitted RORG field, the others
are arbitrary identifiers to select how to read the following data bytes.

Whether such a passively read as opposed to actively polled sensor is
suitable for the iio subsystem would be for Jonathan to comment on.
Presumably such an EnOcean profile driver would have a callback that
receives the payload data and its implementation would then store the
data until it is requested via iio?

Note: It seems that wM-Bus metering payload data beyond frame formats is
even less standardized or documented than EnOcean or Z-Wave. And for
home automation there are a number of entirely proprietary/undocumented
ones based on FSK, too, which then need to go into userspace.

But again, my primary focus before Netdevconf 0x13 will be the PHY
subsystems for LoRa and FSK, not application-specific higher-level
protocols like this one, nor driver frameworks on top as discussed here.

Well, if you have comments on how to go about that, such as on Xue Liu's
PHY device work, do let us know. :)
