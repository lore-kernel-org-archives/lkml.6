The question is what the relevant switch is.  We call pci_enable_acs()
on every PCI device, including Root Ports.  It looks like this relies
on get_upstream_bridge_port() to filter out some things.  I don't
think get_upstream_bridge_port() is doing the right thing, so we need
to sort that out first, I guess.

This might be a good start, but whatever the implications are, they
need to be distilled and made clear directly in the changelog and the
Kconfig help text.
