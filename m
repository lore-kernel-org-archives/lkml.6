Thanks for the explanation. I saw that the result of the AES
encryption was used as the XChaCha nonce, but I failed to spot that
the result of the nhpoly1305 pass is added/subtracted to/from that
particular block first.

In any case, this looks good to me: as far as I can tell, the code
implements the algorithm as described in the paper, and the plumbing
into the crypto API looks correct to me as well.

Reviewed-by: Ard Biesheuvel <ard.biesheuvel@linaro.org>

Whether the paper is correct is a different matter: it looks
convincing to me but IANAC.

The only request I have is to add a speed test to tcrypt as well so we
can easily benchmark it.
