The other thing that we have that is slightly orthogonal to your modes,
which is possible because we just have a __u32 for the fault location,
is that the "oneshot" mode is just a mask added to the fault location
together with "fail_val" is that we can add other masks "fail N times",
"fail randomly 1/N times", or "pass N times before failure".  The other
mask is set in the kernel when the fault was actually hit, so that test
scripts can poll until that happens, and then continue running.

The "fail randomly 1/N times" was useful for detecting memory allocation
failure handling under load, but that has been superseded by the same
functionality in kmalloc(), and it sounds like your fault injection can
do this deterministically for every allocation?

Cheers, Andreas
