Thanks this looks good.. But looks like udelay 20000
is needed with:

# while [ 1 ]; do ifconfig wlan0 down; usleep 20000; \
  ifconfig wlan0 up; done

Otherwise I get the following on warning pandaboard-es:

WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1770 at drivers/bus/omap_l3_noc.c:147
l3_interrupt_handler+0x2f8/0x388
44000000.ocp:L3 Custom Error: MASTER MPU TARGET L4PER2 (Read):
Data Access in User mode during Functional access

Meaning that we access registers while not clocked
somewhere. I think that warning is different from the
earlier errors though :) And we could add a msleep(50)
to the end to mostly avoid it until we have a better
fix available?

Regards,

Tony
