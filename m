Yes, but it's not just scsi_transport_fc, scsi_transport_sas has the
same issue.  I think it's probably just the one liner addition of
blk_drain_queue() that fixes this.  There should probably be a block
primitive that does the correct queue reference dance and calls
blk_cleanup_queue() and blk_drain_queue() in order.

Once you've called bsg_unregister_queue(), the queue will be destroyed
and the reference released once the last job is drained, meaning the
user can keep the bsg device open, but it will just return errors
because of the lack of queue.  This scenario allows removal to proceed
without being held hostage by open devices.

No it won't: after blk_cleanup_queue(), the queue is in bypass mode: no
requests queued after this do anything other than complete with error,
so they never make it into SCSI.

That was before I analyzed the code paths.  Module release is tricky,
because the module exit won't be called until the references drop to
zero, so you have to be careful about not creating a situation where
module exit never gets called and module exit code should force stuff
to detach and wait for the forcing to complete to make up for the
reference circularity problem.  If you do it purely by refcounting, the
module actually may never release (that's why scsi_remove_host works
the way it does, for instance).
