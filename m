I don't want to expand the early quirk infrastructure unless there is
absolutely no other way to solve this.  The early quirk stuff is
x86-specific, and it's not obvious that this problem is x86-only.

This patch scans buses 0-255, but still only in domain 0, so it won't
help with even more complicated systems that use other domains.

I'm not an IRQ expert, but it seems wrong to me that we are enabling
this interrupt before we're ready for it.  The MSI should target an
IOAPIC.  Can't that IOAPIC entry be masked until later?  I guess the
kdump kernel doesn't know what MSI address the device might be using.

Could the IRQ core be more tolerant of this somehow, e.g., if it
notices incoming interrupts with no handler, could it disable the
IOAPIC entry and fall back to polling periodically until a handler is
added?
