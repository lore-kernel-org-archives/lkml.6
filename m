A lot of these bugs are not trivial, but we still need a full analysis of what
failed and what the possible mititgations are. Can you describe more
specifically what causes it?

Correct. We have some functions in the kernel that take 128 pointers
on the stack. This fits fine within the 1024 byte limit on 32 bit, but goes
beyond the same limit on 64 bit. Everything that took more than 1280
bytes (without KASAN) in my analysis was a real problem and reducing
the stack size fixed a bug or improved the code in other ways. I never got
around to reposting all those bug fixes I made back then, and there are
probably a couple new ones we'd need.

I ran into several ciphers in the kernel that required a large stack allocation,
with or without KASAN. Typically these turned out to be optimization bugs
in gcc where gcc tried to be smart about optimizing part of the cipher that
was intentionally designed to not be optimizable, but in the process it
ended up spilling registers to the stack. Adding KASAN into the mix then
added an extra redzone around each of those.

My best approach here was to figure out which optimization step in gcc
caused the register spilling in the first place, and adjust the set of
optimizations done to a specific function in that cipher.

Note that some crypto ciphers are rather performance sensitive and we
have users that care about every percent of performance one can get
out. The bugs that cause the stack size explode beyond a few hundred
bytes that one might expect are usually the same bugs that make the
ciphers much slower than they should be even without KASAN.

For a cryptographic library it might therefore even make sense to have an
even smaller limit (e.g. 400 bytes) in the Makefile and then audit each
case that does not fit into that after determining what exactly caused the
problem, and making sure we find  workaround that produces optmized
object code. When you end up with a function that gcc-8 still
misoptimizes in all optmization levels and you find no other workaround,
please set the higher limit specifically for that function with a gcc version
check in it, and add a comment pointing to the gcc bugzilla report you
have. gcc developers tend to be good about fixing these issues in new
compilers, but the version check helps to ensure we find it if a future
version regresses again, and of course we have to make sure we apply
the hack on all unpatched compilers.

I saw you already posted a patch for that, sorry for not being able to
reply earlier. I actually spent several months of my work to introduce
the KASAN_EXTRA option specifically in order to have a separate
stack size limit for that, so I definitely object to that one. We need the
default (allmodconfig) stack size check to be as small as we can in
order to catch kernel and gcc bugs that bloat the stack more than
it is currently at.

Right. Some background about that limit: 2048 has been what we used
traditionally on 64-bit before KASAN. When I first saw the problems
with KASAN, I had a more detailed look at it and found that we can
significantly reduce it without KASAN, but obviously KASAN needs a
little extra space. I got all my patches upstream to get the KASAN
limit below 2048 and remove that special case for it, and I sent a
lot of the other patches to reduce the limit further to 1280/1535
without/with KASAN, but not all those patches got accepted, so for
the moment that traditional limit is still in place.

clang with KASAN still has known bugs that make it go beyond
2048 bytes, as I said in the other thread, and this is something that
first needs to be addressed in clang before we can take specific
measures in the kernel to work around any remaining unrelated
bugs with clang building our kernel with KASAN.
