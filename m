SGX provides protections for the enclave but not the other way around.
The kernel has all of its normal non-SGX protections in place, but the
enclave can certainly wreak havoc on its userspace process.  The basic
design idea is that the enclave is a specialized .so that gets extra
security protections but is still effectively part of the overall
application, e.g. it has full access to its host userspace process'
virtual memory.
