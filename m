If this is EENTER specific then nesting isn't an issue.  But I don't
see a simple way to restrict the mechanism to EENTER.

What if rather than having userspace register an address for fixup the
kernel instead unconditionally does fixup on the ENCLU opcode?  For
example, skip the instruction and put fault info into some combination
of RDX/RSI/RDI (they're cleared on asynchronous enclave exits).

The decode logic is straightforward since ENCLU doesn't have operands,
we'd just have to eat any ignored prefixes.  The intended convention
for EENTER is to have an ENCLU at the AEX target (to automatically do
ERESUME after INTR, etc...), so this would work regardless of whether
the fault happened on EENTER or in the enclave.  EENTER/ERESUME are
the only ENCLU functions that are allowed outside of an enclave so
there's no danger of accidentally crushing something else.

This way we wouldn't need a VDSO blob and we'd enforce the kernel's
ABI, e.g. a library that tried to use signal handling would go off the
rails when the kernel mucked with the registers.  We could even have
the SGX EPC fault handler return VM_FAULT_SIGBUS if the faulting
instruction isn't ENCLU, e.g. to further enforce that the AEX target
needs to be ENCLU.


Userspace would look something like this:

    mov tcs, %xbx               /* Thread Control Structure address */
    leaq async_exit(%rip), %rcx /* AEX target for EENTER/RESUME */
    mov $SGX_EENTER, %rax       /* EENTER leaf */

async_exit:
    ENCLU

fault_handler:
    <handle fault>

enclave_exit:                   /* EEXIT target */
    <handle enclave request>
