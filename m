Hmm so reading through this series it's made me realize that iolatency is sort
of broken.  It relies on knowing if it needs to do something with the bio if
there is a blkg associated with it.  Before this patchset there wouldn't be a
blkg on the bio unless it was specifically associated.  I'm going to need to
figure out a different way to tag bio's to indicate that blk-iolatency should
care about it.  Probably add a bio flag or something.  Thanks,

Josef
