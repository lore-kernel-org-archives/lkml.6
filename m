I think x86 is the special case here because it implicitly guarantees
the strict ordering in the hardware, as long as the compiler gets it
right. For the asm-generic version, it may be better to play safe and
do the safest version, requiring architectures to override that barrier
if they want to be faster.

We could use the same macros that riscv has, using __io_br(),
__io_ar(), __io_bw() and __io_aw() for before/after read/write.
