Thanks for the detailed analysis! I'm somewhat surprised that the flusher
is able to submit new batch of pages for writeback faster than
__filemap_fdatawait_range() is scanning the radix tree but it is certainly
a possibility.

One has to be really careful when using i_size like this. By the time the
transaction is committing, i_size could have been reduced from the value at
the time page writeback was issued. And that change will be journalled only
in the following transaction. So if the system crashes in the wrong moment,
user could see uninitialized blocks between new_size and old_size after
journal replay. So I don't think your patch is really correct.

Ted has outlined a plan how to get rid of data=ordered limitations [1] and
thus also this problem. It is quite some work but you're certainly welcome
to help out :)
