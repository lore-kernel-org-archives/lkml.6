I'm not the original reporter but I can confirm this regression has been
fixed by git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jejb/scsi.git
scsi-fixes (tag 0c30612d535460af7fe16e7e6ed8b97defe4adbe)

The machine has a HP array and stopped booting some time around rc1. I
tried to bisect it and in the end it was the commit 84676c1f21e8 that I
reverted for testing builds, so I'm sure it's the same issue as you've
been tracking.
