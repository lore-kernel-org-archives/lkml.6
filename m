I saw a couple of his responses, he constantly said to you that you are
reinventing the wheel.

I strongly advise you to read the code, not all drivers are implementing
gids, pkeys and get_netdev() callback.

Yes, you are misunderstanding drivers/infiniband subsystem. We have
plenty options to expose APIs to the user space applications, starting
=66rom standard verbs API and ending with private objects which are
understandable by specific device/driver.

IB stack provides secure FD to access device, by creating context,
after that you can send direct commands to the FW (see mlx5 DEVX
or hfi1) in sane way.

So actually, you will need to register your device, declare your own
set of objects (similar to mlx5 include/uapi/rdma/mlx5_user_ioctl_*.h).

In regards to reference of compression hardware, I don't have.
But there is an example of how T10-DIF can be implemented in verbs
layer:
https://www.openfabrics.org/images/2018workshop/presentations/307_TOved_T10=
-DIFOffload.pdf
Or IPsec crypto:

Most of ib_ prefixes in drivers/infinband/ are legacy names. You can
rename them to be rdma_register_device() if it helps.

So from implementation point of view, as I wrote above.
Create minimal driver to register, expose MR to user space, add your own
objects and capabilities through our new KABI and implement user space part
in github.com/linux-rdma/rdma-core.
