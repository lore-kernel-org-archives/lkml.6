No, that is not guaranteed. Soon as we have reflink support on XFS,
writes will physically move the data to a new physical location.
This is non-negotiatiable, and cannot be blocked forever by a gup
pin.

IOWs, DAX on RDMA requires a) page fault capable hardware so that
the filesystem can move data physically on write access, and b)
revokable file leases so that the filesystem can kick userspace out
of the way when it needs to.

Truncate is a red herring. It's definitely a case for revokable
leases, but it's the rare case rather than the one we actually care
about. We really care about making copy-on-write capable filesystems like
XFS work with DAX (we've got people asking for it to be supported
yesterday!), and that means DAX+RDMA needs to work with storage that
can change physical location at any time.

That's what the revokable file leases provide (it's basically the
same thing as a NFSv4 delegation). We already have all the
infrastructure in the filesystems for triggering revokes when
needed (implemented for pNFS a few years ago), and DAX already
piggy-backs on that infrastructureuses that infrastructure to wait
on gup pinned pages. See dax_layout_busy_page() and BREAK_UNMAP.

The problem is that dax_layout_busy_page can block forever when
userspace pins the file for RDMA. It's not just truncate - it's any
filesystem operation that needs to manipulate the underlying file
layout without doing data IO. i.e. any fallocate() operation, and
when we add reflink support it will include anythign that
shares or de-shares extents between files, too.

The revokable file leases are necessary because access to file data,
internal metadata and the storage is arbitrated by the filesystem,
not the mm/ subsystem and physical pages. i.e. FS-DAX means that the
*filesystem* is managing access to physical pages, not the mm/
subsystem. And we can't just ignore the filesystem in this case
because allowing access to the physical storage outside of the
filesystem's visibility and/or direct control is a potential
security vulnerability, data corruption or filesystem corruption
vector.

And that's the real problem we need to solve here. RDMA has no trust
model other than "I'm userspace, I pinned you, trust me!". That's
not good enough for FS-DAX+RDMA....

Cheers,

Dave.
