It seems like the vqmmc is not added/used in dts (imx53.dtsi). Only the
vmmc-supply is used.

No. This flag is not supported (set) on this host.

Yes, the delay is used (mmc.c Line 1890).
The delay is 7ms (as read from card->ext_csd.sa_timeout).

Increasing it by 10 (or 100) ms doesn't solve the problem.

This needs to be checked.

It may be also possible that the BootROM expects that the eMMC would
not be in SLEEP state (after CMD5 issuing).
