I'd be happy to remove both.  But I wonder how X init works on sparc.

I thought X had code to run the option ROM under emulation and I
wondered if that might rely on the ROM image being at 0xc0000.  Maybe
it reads it from the sysfs "rom" file?  That would be available
regardless of what firmware does, but I have a dim recollection of 
something being more complicated than just reading the image directly
from the ROM.

Maybe Dave or Alex know the details?
