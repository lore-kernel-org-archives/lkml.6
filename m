Hi Rafael, Lorenzo,

I can avoid adding the scan handler in acpi_indirectio.c by skipping the 
child enumeration, like with this change in scan.c:

+static const struct acpi_device_id indirect_io_hosts[] = {
+    {"HISI0191", 0},    /* HiSilicon LPC host */
+    {},
+};
+
+static bool acpi_is_indirect_io_slave(struct acpi_device *device)
+{
+    struct acpi_device *parent = dev->parent;
+
+    if (!parent || acpi_match_device_ids(parent, indirect_io_hosts))
+        return false;
+
+    return true;
+}
+
  static bool acpi_is_serial_bus_slave(struct acpi_device *device)
  {
      struct list_head resource_list;
      bool is_serial_bus_slave = false;

+    if (acpi_is_indirect_io_slave(device))
+        return true;
+
      /* Macs use device properties in lieu of _CRS resources */


This means I can move all this scan code into the LLDD.

What do you think? Please let me know.

John
