I tentatively applied these to pci/virtualization-review.

The code changes look fine, but I want to flesh out the changelogs a
little bit before merging them.

For example, I'm not sure what you mean by "devices where the PF is
not capable of managing VF resources."

It *sounds* like you're saying the hardware works differently on some
devices, but I don't think that's what you mean.  I think you're
saying something about which drivers are used for the PF and the VF.

I think a trivial example of how this will be used might help.  I
assume this involves a virtualization scenario where the host uses the
PF to enable several VFs, but the host doesn't use the PF for much
else.  Then you assign the VFs to guests, and drivers in the guest
OSes use the VFs.

Since .sriov_configure() is only used by sriov_numvfs_store(), I
assume the usage model involves writing to the sysfs sriov_numvfs
attribute to enable the VFs, then assigning them to guests?
