Nothing was wrong about about that, this part did not changed (see my

There is a misunderstanding about this chaining mechanism. This should
not be confused with the list of seccomp filters nor the cgroup
hierarchies. Landlock programs can be stacked the same way seccomp's
filters can (cf. struct landlock_prog_set, the "chain_last" field is an
optimization which is not used for this struct handling). This stackable
property did not changed from the previous patch series. The chaining
mechanism is for another use case, which does not make sense for seccomp
filters nor other eBPF program types, at least for now, from what I can
tell.

You may want to get a look at my talk at FOSDEM
(https://landlock.io/talks/2018-02-04_landlock-fosdem.pdf), especially
slides 11 and 12.

Let me explain my reasoning about this program chaining thing.

To check if an action on a file is allowed, we first need to identify
this file and match it to the security policy. In a previous
(non-public) patch series, I tried to use one type of eBPF program to
check every kind of access to a file. To be able to identify a file, I
relied on an eBPF map, similar to the current inode map. This map store
a set of references to file descriptors. I then created a function
bpf_is_file_beneath() to check if the requested file was beneath a file
in the map. This way, no chaining, only one eBPF program type to check
an access to a file... but some issues then emerged. First, this design
create a side-channel which help an attacker using such a program to
infer some information not normally available, for example to get a hint
on where a file descriptor (received from a UNIX socket) come from.
Another issue is that this type of program would be called for each
component of a path. Indeed, when the kernel check if an access to a
file is allowed, it walk through all of the directories in its path
(checking if the current process is allowed to execute them). That first
attempt led me to rethink the way we could filter an access to a file
*path*.

To minimize the number of called to an eBPF program dedicated to
validate an access to a file path, I decided to create three subtype of
eBPF programs. The FS_WALK type is called when walking through every
directory of a file path (except the last one if it is the target). We
can then restrict this type of program to the minimum set of functions
it is allowed to call and the minimum set of data available from its
context. The first implicit chaining is for this type of program. To be
able to evaluate a path while being called for all its components, this
program need to store a state (to remember what was the parent directory
of this path). There is no "previous" field in the subtype for this
program because it is chained with itself, for each directories. This
enable to create a FS_WALK program to evaluate a file hierarchy, thank
to the inode map which can be used to check if a directory of this
hierarchy is part of an allowed (or denied) list of directories. This
design enables to express a file hierarchy in a programmatic way,
without requiring an eBPF helper to do the job (unlike my first experimen=
t).

The explicit chaining is used to tied a path evaluation (with a FS_WALK
program) to an access to the actual file being requested (the last
component of a file path), with a FS_PICK program. It is only at this
time that the kernel check for the requested action (e.g. read, write,
chdir, append...). To be able to filter such access request we can have
one call to the same program for every action and let this program check
for which action it was called. However, this design does not allow the
kernel to know if the current action is indeed handled by this program.
Hence, it is not possible to implement a cache mechanism to only call
this program if it knows how to handle this action.

The approach I took for this FS_PICK type of program is to add to its
subtype which action it can handle (with the "triggers" bitfield, seen
as ORed actions). This way, the kernel knows if a call to a FS_PICK
program is necessary. If the user wants to enforce a different security
policy according to the action requested on a file, then it needs
multiple FS_PICK programs. However, to reduce the number of such
programs, this patch series allow a FS_PICK program to be chained with
another, the same way a FS_WALK is chained with itself. This way, if the
user want to check if the action is a for example an "open" and a "read"
and not a "map" and a "read", then it can chain multiple FS_PICK
programs with different triggers actions. The OR check performed by the
kernel is not a limitation then, only a way to know if a call to an eBPF
program is needed.

The last type of program is FS_GET. This one is called when a process
get a struct file or change its working directory. This is the only
program type able (and allowed) to tag a file. This restriction is
important to not being subject to resource exhaustion attacks (i.e.
tagging every inode accessible to an attacker, which would allocate too
much kernel memory).

This design gives room for improvements to create a cache of eBPF
context (input data, including maps if any), with the result of an eBPF
program. This would help limit the number of call to an eBPF program the
same way SELinux or other kernel components do to limit costly checks.

The eBPF maps of progs are useful to call the same type of eBPF
program. It does not fit with this use case because we may want multiple
eBPF program according to the action requested on a kernel object (e.g.
FS_GET). The other reason is because the eBPF program does not know what
will be the next (type of) access check performed by the kernel.

To say it another way, this chaining mechanism is a way to split a
kernel object evaluation with multiple specialized programs, each of
them being able to deal with data tied to their type. Using a monolithic
eBPF program to check everything does not scale and does not fit with
unprivileged use either.

As a side note, the cookie value is only an ephemeral value to keep a
state between multiple programs call. It can be used to create a state
machine for an object evaluation.

I don't see a way to do an efficient and programmatic path evaluation,
with different access checks, with the current eBPF features. Please let
me know if you know how to do it another way.
