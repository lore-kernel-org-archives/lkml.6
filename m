First, I thought I preferred this option, as it becomes clear of what
goes on. However I then realize, that it may not be worth it, because
in the end I guess the caller (sdhci), will not be able to deal with
error codes. For example, what would it do if it receives  a -ENOTSUPP
from mmc_gpio_get_cd_nosleep()?
