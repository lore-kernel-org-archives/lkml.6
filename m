So meta :) The URL refers an lwn article, which in turn refers to this effort's
first RFC.  As someone only getting *one* of these patches in emails, It would
be useful if the cover letter referenced instead an optional git tree and
branch so one could easily get the patches for more careful inspection. In the
meantime, can you make such tree available with a branch?

Also, since kernel/module.c is involved it would be wise to include Jessica,
which I've Cc'd. I'm going to guess Kees may like to review this too. Mimi
might want to help review as well.

Rafael may care about suspend/resume implications of these "umh modules" as
you put it.

> the request_module()

Upon inspection you never touch or use request_module() so this is
false and misleading. You don't use or extend request_module() at all, you rely
on extending finit_module() so that load_module() itself will now execute (via
modified do_execve_file()) the same file which was loaded as an module.

This is *very* different given request_module() has its own full magic and is
in and of itself a UMH of the kernel implemented in kernel/kmod.c.

Nevertheless, why?

It sounds like finit_module() module loading is used as a convenience factor
simply to take advantage of being able to ship / maintain/ compile these umh
programs as part of the kernel. Is that right?

So the finit_module() interface was just a convenient mechanism. Is that right?

Ie, if folks had these binaries in place the regular UMH interface / API could be
used so that these could be looked for, but instead we want to carry these
in tandem with the kernel?

If so this still seems like an overly complex way to deal with this.

OK so the use case envisioned here was for networking code to do
something like:

	if (!loaded) {
		err = request_module("bpfilter");
		...
	}

This is visible on your third patch (this is from your RFC, not this series):

https://www.mail-archive.com/netfilter-devel@vger.kernel.org/msg11129.html

So indeed all this patch does in the end is just putting tons of wrappers in
place so that kernel code can load certain trusted UMH programs we ship, and
maintain in the kernel.

request_module() has its own world though too. How often in your proof of
concept is request_module() called? How many times do you envision it being
called?

Please review lib/test_kmod.c and tools/testing/selftests/kmod/ for testing
your stuff too or consider extending appropriately.

Are aliases something which you expect we'll need to support for these
userspace... modules?

Now, this sounds great, however I think that the proof of concept chosen is
pretty complex to start off with. Even if its not designed to be a real
world life use case, a much simpler proof of concept to do something
more simple may be useful, if possible. One wouldn't need to to have it
replace a kernel functionality in real life. lib/ is full of CONFIG_TEST_*
examples, a simple new stupid kernel functionality which can in turn be replaced
with a respective userspace counterpart may be useful, and both kconfig
entries would be mutually exclusive.

Great too.

I don't see how this is defining any boundary, I see just a loader for a
userspace program, and re-using a kernel interface known, finit_module() which
makes it convenient for us to load pre-compiled kernel junk. I'm still
not convinced this is the right approach.

> It's easy to distinguish "umh module" from traditional kernel module:

Ah you said it, "umh module". I don't see what makes it a "umh module" so far,
all we are doing is executing a userspace program a la UMH. But its a
synchronous call, so we wait. The only modular thing here I see is we took the
finit_module() to be able to loader programs compiled in the kernel. Its not
using existing kernel symbols, its not exported symbols, etc.

Trying to avoid the "module infra" in theory sounds great, however you
did extend it a bit.

Also, the umh has its own infrastructure which I've slowly also been trying to
groom and cleanup with a few wtf's still left in place and which if we don't
take care, extending this use could backfire in other ways. Feedback
below.

That also means we have a namespace collision between these programs
and kernel modules. Does compilation warn if we hit a conflict here
already? What about with aliases?

run_umh() calls the program and waits. Note that while we are running a UMH we
can't suspend. What if they take forever, who is hosing them down with an
equivalent:

	schedule();
	try_to_freeze();

Say they are buggy and never return, will they stall suspend, have you tried?

call_usermodehelper_exec() uses helper_lock() which in turn is used for
umh's accounting for number of running umh's. One of the sad obscure uses
for this is to deal with suspend/resume. Refer to __usermodehelper* calls
on kernel/power/process.c

Note how you use UMH_WAIT_EXEC too, so this is all synchronous.

How many of these calls do you expect to be flying through? Is there any
chance a system could want to keep spawning a lot of these without any
chance of them yielding a bit?

I'm not a fan of this use of the UMH lock thing, but the reason for it was back
in the day today's firmware fallback mechanism used to be the default firmware
loading interface, and it relied on a sysfs loading interface, and *with* this
UMH locking thing we prevented system stalls on suspend/resume by first
checking if they were supposed to run or not. But *only* the firmware loader
interface uses the UMH lock API calls:

  o usermodehelper_read_lock_wait()
  o usermodehelper_read_trylock()

A long term goal which I had recently was to actually get rid of these stupid
calls at least out of the way from the direct firmware lookup calls since no
UMH was involved and fortunately we fast-paced that that upstream [0], refer to
"devil is in the details".

[0] https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9949775/

But -- other than not stalling suspend, an other implicit reason for it, was in
turn the assumption that the files would be available whenever the callers (in
this case the firmware API) needed them, and then there could be a race with
the UMH callers and any respective subsystem filesystem which provides the files
going down. This is a *theoretical* consideration any other UMH caller needs to
make today.

This later race is addressed today with the firmware cache implementation, for
direct firmware filesystem lookups. 

And yes, if you are trying to poke around files from the filesystem and are
suspending/resuming you may just not get access to some of them today, I just
dealt with one case recently reported [1]. So the firmware cache is *still*
required today.

Seeing any new broad user of of the UMH gives me concern if the above lessons
are not taken into consideration. Do we *need* these files to be sure to be
present during suspend/resume? How are we sure we won't race with
suspend/resume?

What if the same file is loaded multiple times, why not have one shared file
pointer, and have all users use that while such requests are in place?  The
firmware loader has this in place with "batched requests".

[1] https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20180227232101.20786-1-mcgrof@kernel.org

If it sounds like the direct firmware loading interface is more robust, and
reliable, and tested to load files its because that is exactly what it was
designed to do. The kernel UMH is a simple interface with limited use and I'd
caution further *extensive* uses of it.

So I guess this check is done *after* run_umh() then, what about the enforce mode,

I wonder if from an LSM perspective security_kernel_read_file() and
READING_MODULE will suffice or if we want to have a different identifier here.
