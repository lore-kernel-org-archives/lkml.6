Agreed, inside the kernel the padding achieves nothing.

Digression:

Since we don't traditionally zero the tail-padding in the user sigframe,
is there a reliable way for userspace to detect newly-added fields in
siginfo other than by having an explicit sigaction sa_flags flag to
request them?  I imagine something like [1] below from the userspace
perspective.

On a separate thread, the issue of how to report syndrome information
for SIGSEGV came up [2] (such as whether the faulting instruction was a
read or a write).  This information is useful (and used) by things like
userspace sanitisers and qemu.  Currently, reporting this to userspace
relies on arch-specific cruft in the sigframe.

We're committed to maintaining what's already in each arch sigframe,
but it would be preferable to have a portable way of adding information
to siginfo in a generic way.  si_code doesn't really work for that,
since si_codes are mutually exclusive: I can't see a way of adding
supplementary information using si_code.

Anyway, that would be a separate RFC in the future (if ever).

Cheers
