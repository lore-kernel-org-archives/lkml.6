The linkup notifier is used just to prevent the system from wasting cpu cycles.
Without linkup notifier, pci_epf_test will start checking for commands from
host after the pci_epf_test is bound to the EP controller (bind() callback)
though the host can issue commands only when after the link is up. So for
platforms which supports linkup notification, it's better we poll command
register only after link is established.

The problem is because pci-epf-test cannot be described in HW. pci-epf-test is
also not automatically bound to the EP controller but is bound by the user like
below
ln -s functions/pci_epf_test/func1 controllers/51000000.pcie_ep/

So given that user anyways has to bind the epf device to the controller, based
on the platform the user can use a different configfs entry like below
ln -s functions/pci_epf_test_dw/func1 controllers/51000000.pcie_ep/ or
ln -s functions/pci_epf_test_k2g/func1 controllers/21800000.pcie-ep/

If the epf can be described in dt, then something like below can be done
pcie1_ep: pcie_ep@51000000 {
	compatible = "ti,dra7-pcie-ep";
	interrupts = <0 232 0x4>;
	num-lanes = <1>;
	num-ib-windows = <4>;
	num-ob-windows = <16>;
	phys = <&pcie1_phy>;
	phy-names = "pcie-phy0";
	pci_epf_test: pci_epf_test@0 {
		name = "pci_epf_test_dw";
		<other properties>;
	}
};

With this pci-dra7xx.c driver should create pci_epf_device using
pci_epf_create("pci_epf_test_dw");

Then the driver_data corresponding to "pci_epf_test_dw" will select linkup
notifier or BAR index etc.

Having different pci_epf_device_id entries and corresponding driver_data for
each entry seems fine to me (as done in this patch). We use configfs only since
pci_epf_test cannot be described in dt.

Thanks
Kishon
