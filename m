Hi Greg,

I also note that currently we have an inconsistency in license of 
sas_init.c:

/*
  * Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) Transport Layer initialization
  *
  * Copyright (C) 2005 Adaptec, Inc.  All rights reserved.

  */

...

MODULE_AUTHOR("Luben Tuikov <luben_tuikov@adaptec.com>");
MODULE_DESCRIPTION("SAS Transport Layer");
MODULE_LICENSE("GPL v2");

So the license specifies v2+ but module license states v2.

I could not find a docment for guidance on this. I also note that making 
sas_task.c v2 would mean mixing v2 and v2+ into the module.

I did find an example of someone changing the license:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-designware-slave.c?h=v4.20-rc4&id=15c566fcff9cc7b8fd64461d6ee6fd1bc665b444

Then someone changes the module license (but same company):
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/sound/soc/sh/rcar/core.c?h=v4.20-rc4&id=1e0edd4deadbbacd3b35179c233efa26624ab2af

At this point I'm reluctant to touch this in case I mess up, but there 
is still the missing license in sas_task.c .

Thanks,
John
