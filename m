Sorry, but it's easy to lost something on lkml, so adding the dm-devel
ML and the maintainers.

IIRC the patch is there since 4.12 and I tried to reproduce the issue
on at least two devices, my laptop and a Chromebook Pixel 2 without
luck. Also, I am a bit surprised that nobody else has complained,
maybe I missed it, and *of course*, this doesn't mean the issue is not
there.

So, did anyone experience the same issue?
