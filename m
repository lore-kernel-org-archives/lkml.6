But as I understand this series, we're not really targeting specific
sets of devices either.  It's more of a shotgun approach that we
disable ACS on downstream switch ports and hope that we get the right
set of devices, but with the indecisiveness that we might later
white-list select root ports to further increase the blast radius.

That argument makes sense if we had the ability to select specific sets
of devices, but that's not the case here, right?  With the shotgun
approach, we're clearly favoring one at the expense of the other and
it's not clear why we don't simple force the needle all the way in that
direction such that the results are at least predictable.

If IOMMU grouping implies device assignment (because nobody else uses
it to the same extent as device assignment) then the build-time option
falls to pieces, we need a single kernel that can do both.  I think we
need to get more clever about allowing the user to specify exactly at
which points in the topology they want to disable isolation.  Thanks,

Alex
