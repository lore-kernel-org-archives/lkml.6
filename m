While that may not be a problem strictly speaking (the root port resume
only takes place when the port itself has been suspended, so this should
not interfere with PME handling for the devices under it), but it also is
not necessary in that case, because the platform firmware doesn't mess up
with the root port's PM registers then.

Or if it does, the whole PCIe PM is managed by AML/SMM and we should not
even touch this register at all.
