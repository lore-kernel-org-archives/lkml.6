Yes. Or we can use encrypted key. It depends on different use case.

If the trusted key is sealed with PCRs, then we can not generate
new trusted key after PCRs be capped. Then we can only use the
encrypted key as the session key.

I see you point. Yes, TPM or EFI key can only be used to prevent that the
content in snapshot image be detected on other machine. It can not be used
to prevent the snapshot image be resumed on _the same_ machine by different
user. Sounds like B can physical accessing the machine. Could you please
explain more detail for the case? 

As you said, password is useful in this case. But I have no idea for how
to introduce password without user space helper. And user space helper
must be authenticate by kernel. Which means that we need to add mechanism
to verify user space binary.
