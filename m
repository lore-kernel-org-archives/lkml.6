But we are not talking about kernel-support here, this interface is
user-facing, and for an interfaces that was made so people could send
arbitrary SCSI commands, that the kernel doesn't support.

Its probably also more complicated to make sure that no one is using
that, in contrast to the OSD stuff that - as state in the patch-letter -
never made it out of academia. Its not like anyone has to release
anything open if they use BSG/SG, its just syscalls after all.
