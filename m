Wouldn't that break USB?

Yes, that's it.

No, I mean to use dpm_list instead of devices_kset for shutdown.

They should be in the same order anyway if all is correct.

So I think that we simply need to drop the devices_kset_move_last() call
from really_probe() as it is plain incorrect and the use case for it is
questionable at best.

And the use case it is supposed to address should be addressed differently.
