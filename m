I'm not sure if this is worth the extra complexity either, which is
why I have no strong opinion here. :-)

Maybe you can add a comment, next to the prp_guids[] definition, to
explain that the GUIDs are made equivalent to each other in order to
avoid extra complexity in the properties handling code, with the
caveat that the kernel will accept certain combinations of GUIDs and
properties that are not defined strictly speaking without warning, but
those combinations of GUIDs and properties are not expected to be used
by firmware and they should be caught by firmware validation tools and
reported as errors anyway.
