Subject: [PULL 1/2] vfio-ccw: update documentation

The vfio-ccw documentation comes from the cover letter of the
original patch submission, which shows in some parts. Give it some
love; in particular:

- Remove/rework statements that make sense in a cover letter, but not
  in regular documentation.
- Fix some typos.
- Describe the current limitations in more detail.

 * CCW translation APIs
-- Description:
-  These introduce a group of APIs (start with 'cp_') to do CCW
-  translation. The CCWs passed in by a user space program are
-  organized with their guest physical memory addresses. These APIs
-  will copy the CCWs into the kernel space, and assemble a runnable
