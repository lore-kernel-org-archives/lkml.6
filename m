Alright, I now have an uptime of over 20 hours, with
scsi_mod.use_blk_mq=1 dm_mod.use_blk_mq=1

I did upgrade from 4.15.13 to 4.15.14 in the process, but a quick look
at the changes doesn't have anything jump out at me as impacting this.

So I'm reasonably comfortable stating that disabling
CONFIG_DEBUG_BLK_CGROUP was sufficient to render this stable.
