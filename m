I would like to give a bit more background on this HW. This HW is now 
for us a legacy device. It will be used in no more chipsets. It is only 
used in hip06 and hip07 chipsets on our D03 and D05 boards, 
respectively. On these boards we have the following LPC slave devices only:
D03: UART, IPMI
D05: IPMI

Supporting IPMI for D05 is required. Supporting legacy D03 and the UART 
is a "nice-to-have". But it is definitely ok for us to not support this 
device.

Our previous ACPI support solution did use a scan handler for this host, 
but there was some sensible pushback on this - please check this if not 
familiar: https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/2/14/532

Overall it does not make sense to try to move this back to drivers/acpi 
and receive more pushback from that direction, and only delay 
indefinitely upstreaming this driver (which is now running at ~27 months 
since v1) to just support a PNP-compatible device which we don't care 
too much about.

I didn't think so. But now I have noticed that ACPI_ID_LEN is 9 (which 
of course it needs to be for pnpid name), and not 8. I was thinking that 
the sizeof(MFD_CHILD_NAME_PREFIX) was providing the extra byte for the 
NULL terminator I required.

The idea is that having no IO resources is a failure for a slave device 
on this bus. So then, if count == 0, we should error.

Should be possible. I just want to keep checkpatch happy.

Right, because we need to group the MFD cells together.

As explained above, actually no in reality. So I should comment on this.

Again, as above, this would not happen. I could make the code more 
generic, but I feel that there is little gain.
