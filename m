Let me know if you want me to mail that patch again.

Perhaps Nick can comment on whether something like
-fno-absolute-addressing would be feasible in clang. Although even if
it gets implemented, it won't fix the already released clang versions.

I've rechecked and I think I was wrong here. I disabled
COFNIG_JUMP_LABEL while trying to get the kernel booting before I
added the kvm flags. It seems it's not needed after all.

But just for the reference, I'm using 4.16-rc4 with a patch to fix
SMCCC issues that you mentioned. As for clang, I'm using LLVM revision
325711 (a couple of weeks old).
