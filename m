Hi! I remember that in time of migration from platform board code to
device tree structures there appeared some bug which caused that
sometimes display were not initialized. And somebody figured out that
display initialization is failing when some other SPI devices are
initialized before or after display... This behavior was observed only
on real N900 hardware, not in qemu. Real reason was never explained. In
old platform board code there was hardcoded order of SPI devices in
which initialization happened. And in device tree it is probably in
(pseudo)-random order. Enabling/disabling various config option can
affect some timings and order in which kernel starts probing and
initializing devices...
