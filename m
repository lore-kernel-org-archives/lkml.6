I don't think this is correct.  A Root Port defines a hierarchy domain
(I'm looking at PCIe r4.0, sec 1.3.1).  The capability to route
peer-to-peer transactions *between* hierarchy domains is optional.  I
think this means a Root Complex is not required to route transactions
from one Root Port to another Root Port.

This doesn't say anything about routing between two different devices
below a Root Port.  Those would be in the same hierarchy domain and
should follow the conventional PCI routing rules.  Of course, since a
Root Port has one link that leads to one device, they would probably
be different functions of a single multi-function device, so I don't
know how practical it would be to test this.

This sounds like the same issue as above, so we just need to resolve
that.

OK.  I accept that it might be convenient, but I still think it leads
to a weird API.  Maybe that's OK; I don't know enough about the
scenario in the caller to do anything more than say "hmm, strange".

OK, I'll take your word for that.  I'm fine with this as long as it is
performance-sensitive.
