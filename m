It's not a KVM uapi.

KVM isn't a hypervisor in the traditional sense.  The "real" hypervisor
lives in userspace, e.g. Qemu, KVM is essentially just a (very fancy)
driver for hardware accelerators, e.g. VMX.  Qemu for example is fully
capable of running an x86 VM without KVM, it's just substantially slower.

In terms of guest memory, KVM doesn't care or even know what a particular
region of memory represents or what, if anything, is backing a region in
the host.  There are cases when KVM is made aware of certain aspects of
guest memory for performance or functional reasons, e.g. emulated MMIO
and encrypted memory, but in all cases the control logic ultimately
resides in userspace.

SGX is a weird case because ENCLS can't be emulated in software, i.e.
exposing SGX to a VM without KVM's help would be difficult.  But, it
wouldn't be impossible, just slow and ugly.

And so, ignoring host oversubscription for the moment, there is no hard
requirement that SGX EPC can only be exposed to a VM through KVM.  In
other words, allocating and exposing EPC to a VM is orthogonal to KVM
supporting SGX.  Exposing EPC to userspace via /dev/sgx/epc would mean
that KVM would handle it like any other guest memory region, and all EPC
related code/logic would reside in the SGX subsystem.

Oversubscription throws a wrench in the system because ENCLV can only
be executed post-VMXON and EPC conflicts generate VMX VM-Exits.  But
even then, KVM doesn't need to own the EPC uapi, e.g. it can call into
the SGX subsystem to handle EPC conflict VM-Exits and the SGX subsystem
can wrap ENCLV with exception fixup and forcefully reclaim EPC pages if
ENCLV faults.

I can't be 100% certain the oversubscription scheme will be sane without
actually writing the code, but I'd like to at least keep the option open,
i.e. not structure /dev/sgx/ in such a way that adding e.g. /dev/sgx/epc
is impossible or ugly.
