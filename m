Yep, aside from asking Amazon to submit a native host driver, this is
the only option I'm seeing as well.  Of course vfio would need to taint
the kernel since it's not doing anything to restrict the usage of those
potentially compromised vfs, and then we need to think about how much
code we're willing to introduce and maintain to enable unsupported use
cases.

Re-reading a register doesn't seem so terrible.  Of course, unless we
can solve the tainting problem, it doesn't matter.  Either an ioctl or
emulation is more code than I'm willing to maintain for a taint-only
interface.  Thanks,
