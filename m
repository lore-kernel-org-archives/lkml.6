Note that HMM takes care of that RDMA ODP with my ODP to HMM patch,
so what you get for an ODP umem is just a list of dma address you
can program your device to. The aim is to avoid the driver to care
about that. The access policy when the UMEM object is created by
userspace through verbs API should however ascertain that for mmap
of device file it is only creating a UMEM that is fully covered by
one and only one vma. GPU device driver will have one vma per logical
GPU object. I expect other kind of device do that same so that they
can match a vma to a unique object in their driver.

Yes, you do not need page for simple driver, if we start creating struct
page for all PCIE BAR we are gonna waste a lot of memory and resources
for no good reason. I doubt all of the PCIE BAR of a device enabling p2p
will ever be map as p2p. So simple driver do not need struct page, GPU
driver that do not use HMM (all GPU that are more than 2 years old) do
not need struct page. Struct page is a burden here more than anything
else. I have not seen one good thing the struct page gives you.

Jérôme
