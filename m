Has anyone seen seen the ECRs in the PCIe base spec and ACPI that have =0A=

I wouldn't expect anything less than  complete scrutiny and quality =0A=
control of unquestionable moral integrity :). In theory ~0 can be a =0A=
great indicator that something may be wrong. Though I think it's about =0A=
as ad-hoc as pci_dev_is_disconnected().=0A=
=0A=
I slightly like the idea of wrapping the MMIO accessors. There's still =0A=
memcpy and DMA that cause the same MemRead/Wr PCIe transactions, and the =
=0A=
same sort of errors in PCIe land, and it would be good to have more =0A=
testing on this. Since this patch is tested and confirmed to fix a known =
=0A=
failure case, I would keep it, and the look at fixing the problem in a =0A=
more generic way.=0A=
=0A=
BTW, a lot of the problems we're fixing here come courtesy of =0A=
firmware-first error handling. Do we reach a point where we draw a line =0A=
in handling new problems introduced by FFS? So, if something is a =0A=
problem with FFS, but not native handling, do we commit to supporting it?=
