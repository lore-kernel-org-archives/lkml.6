OK, then I will remove the features that aren't included in this patchset,
and add them later with implementation.

Yes. Only FME and Port is defined now, and AFU is always connected to a port.

No.

Agree. Feature Region is mentioned in spec, but let's use Feature Register Set
or Header Register Set instead, as it seems to be more clear. Will update the
diagram as well.

No, it's not FPGAs in SoC's, but server platform with in-package FPGA.
There are 2 different private features for performance reporting, one is for
the in-package FPGA on server, the other one is for discrete PCIe FPGA
acceleration cards.

To be accurate, will use "server integrated" instead to avoid confusion.
But anyway, these will be removed for now as they are not implemented in this
patchset.

Sorry for the confusion. Will remove it and add it later with implementation.
It's the in-package FPGA on server platform, e.g Xeon + FPGA. socket_id is a
read-only value from the hardware register, it indicates which socket the FPGA
belongs to. e.g 1 server may have 2 sockets, each socket has one integrated FPGA
device. Userspace could use this information to distinguish the FPGA devices in
the same server platform and choose resources (e.g CPU, memory) closer to the
dedicated FPGA for lower latency and better performance.
