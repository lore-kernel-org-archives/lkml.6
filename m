ACPI 6.2:

18.3.2.4 PCI Express Root Port AER Structure

Flags:

Bit [0] - FIRMWARE_FIRST: If set, this bit indicates to the OSPM that system 
firmware will handle errors from this source first.
Bit [1] - GLOBAL: If set, indicates that the settings contained in this 
structure apply globally to all PCI Express Devices.
All other bits must be set to zero.

It doesn't say shall, may or might. It says will.

I think It depends on your PCI topology.

For other topologies with multiple PCI root complexes, I can see this being
used per root complex flag to indicate which root complex needs firmware first
and which one doesn't.

I'm already aware of two systems that rely on HEST table to pass information to
the OS that firmware first is enabled. Both of the systems do not change their
_OSC bits during this assuming HEST table has priority over _OSC for firmware
first.

If we add this patch, OS will try to claim the AER address space while firmware
wants exclusive access.

As I said in my previous email, the right place to talk about this is UEFI
forum.
