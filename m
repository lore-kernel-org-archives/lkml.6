As the name implies, its supposed to wait for the reference count to be zero
indefinately, but yes, under normal operation, its intended to not have to wait
very long at all.  The issuance of the NETDEV_UNREGISTER_FINAL notification is
meant to be a subscribable signal to any code path holding a reference that it
needs to be dropped so that the progress can be made.

Note that the "waiting for %s to become free" message is triggered after 10
seconds of waiting, and is likely the trigger you want, Its just an emergency
level log message rather a WARN.  I don't think we want to change that
permanently, but you could certainly alter it in the code to cause syzbot to
catch it (i.e. WARN_ON(time_after(jiffies, warning_time + 10 * HZ)) )

Well, it drops everything and sleeps periodically, so its safe in and of itself.
The problem is its waiting for the reference count of a device to drop to zero,
and some other execution context isn't taking the appropriate action to do that.
