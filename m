Thanks for looking this over!

You're right, "dev" here is not necessarily the Root Port, so this
changelog is bogus.  "dev" came from e_info->dev[] from
aer_process_err_devices().

I think to be more precise, aer_irq() reads the Root Port's
PCI_ERR_ROOT_ERR_SRC register, which gives us the Requester ID from
the ERR_* message.  Then find_source_device() walks the tree starting
with the Root Port, looking for:

  - a device that matches the Requester ID, or
  - a device that doesn't match the Requester ID (e.g., because a VMD
    port clears the source ID) but has AER enabled and has logged an
    error of the same type (ERR_COR vs ERR_FATAL/NONFATAL) we're
    currently decoding

So there might be multiple "dev" pointers in e_info->dev[] because
several devices could have logged errors.

I'm not convinced the vendor/device ID is that useful because there
might be several devices with the same ID, so it doesn't really tell
you which one.  The Requester ID (bus/device/function) is the
important thing.

The current code is not ideal because the find_source_device() path
depends on the pci_dev still being present and even accessible (so we
can read DEVCTL, ERR_COR_STATUS, etc), which might not be the case.

If find_source_device() fails, i.e., it can't find a matching pci_dev
and prints the "can't find device of ID%04x" message, we're in real
trouble because we don't call aer_process_err_devices(), which means
we don't clear PCI_ERR_COR_STATUS.

Anyway, I'll abandon this change for now since it's not a clear
improvement.
