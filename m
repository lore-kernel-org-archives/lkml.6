Andrew, I totally share your concerns.

However, I think the reality is that at best we can strongly urge
people to do such a large amount of work such as writing a new
switchdev/DSA driver for this cpsw hardware.

We can't really compel them.

And a stick could have the opposite of it's intended effect.  If still
nobody wants to do the switchdev/DSA driver, then this existing one
rots and even worse we can end up with an out-of-tree version of this
driver that has the changes (such as this one) that people want.

I'd like to see the switchdev/DSA driver for cpsw as much as you do,
but I am not convinced that rejecting patches like this one will
necessarily make that happen.

Also, it would be a completely different situation if we had someone
working on the switchdev/DSA version already.

So as it stands I really don't think we can block this patch.

Thank you.
