Thats possible, but I think thats pretty equivalaent to what daves saying, in
that he wants us to identify all the sizes of this struct and the git history
and act on them accordingly.  Having internal versions of the struct seems like
a fine way to get there, but I think we need to consider how we got to this
situations before we go down the implementation path.

I'm not sure this even makes sense.  Currently (as I understood it), the issue
we are facing is the one in which an application is built against a newer kernel
and run on an older one, the implication there being that the application will
pass in a buffer that is larger than what the kernel expects.  In that
situation, clearing isn't needed, all thats needed (I think), is a memcmp of the
space between the sizeof(kernel struct version), and sizeof(userspace struct
version) to see if any bits are non-zero.  If they are, we error out, otherwise,
we ignore the space and move forward as though that overage doesn't exist.

Mind you, I'm not (yet) advocating for that approach, just trying to clarify
whats needed.

Yes, thats the use case that we're trying to address.

FWIW, before we decide on a course of action, I think I need to point out that,
over the last 10 years, we've extended this structure 6 times, in the following
commits:
0f3fffd8ab1db
7e8616d8e7731
e1cdd553d482c
35ea82d611da5
c95129d127c6d
b444153fb5a64

The first two I believe were modifications during a period when sctp was
actually getting integrated to the kernel, but the last 4 were definately done
during more recent development periods and wen't in without any commentary about
the impact to UAPI compatibility.  The check for optlen > sizeof(struct
sctp_event_subscribe) was made back in 2008, and while not spelled out, seems
pretty clearly directed at enforcing compatibility with older appliations, not
compatibility with newer applications running on older kernels.

I really worry about situations in which we need to support applications
expecting features that the running kernel doesn't have.  In this particular
situation it seems like a fixable thing, but I could envision situations in
which we just can't do it, and I don't want to set that expectation when we
can't consistently meet it.

So, if the consensus is that we need to support applications built on newer
kernels, but run on older kernels (and I'd like to get verbal consensus on
that), then we need to identify a method to fix this.  I'm still hesitant to
do anything that involves us accepting any size buffer over the kernel expected
size, as that puts us in a position to have to read large amounts of user data
(i.e. possible DOS), and just picking an arbitrary large number to limit the
buffer size seems wrong.  What if, on receipt of a structure from a newer kernel
(implying a size larger than what the kernel expects), we clamp optlen to the
kernel size, and put_user it back to the application?  i.e. we don't check any
data above and beyond what the the kernel knows about, but we use the optlen as
an indicator to user space that not all the data was processed?  That allows the
kernel to ignore the overage safely, and while its not in the socket api
extension RFC, its not violating anything, and is something we can document in
the sctp(7) man page as a linux only behavior.

Thoughts?
