I like that name better.

It isn't clear that this needs to go to a system header because I
expect ext4 will only support BREAK_UNMAPI for dax and not care about
BREAK_WRITE since that is an XFS-only / pNFS-only distinction in
current code. However, I'll let Jan chime in if this guess is
incorrect and ext4 plans to add pNFS block-server support.

Add should not be a problem because DMA only ever starts after extents
are added, i.e. there's no risk of DMA starting to invalid address
because fs/dax.c arranges for extents to be allocated at fault time.
