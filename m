On the other hand, XFS has a few commits that fix possible
corruptions, that have never ended up in a stable tree. Isn't it just
as bad ("playing roulette") for users?

Thank you for your input Dave. Let me give you the background for why
I've been doing it this way up to now to explain my reasoning, and
where I was wrong.

After I've built the initial framework for this, I ran it through a
set of kernel versions and ended up with a massively large set of
commits that were detected as bug fixes but didn't end up getting in
stable trees.

My thinking back then was that I can start building branches of
proposed commits, send them to their respective authors/maintainers,
and remove any patches that maintainers objected to their inclusion.
This process ran for a few months, and a few thousand patches (between
all kernel trees) went in this way. The rate of rejection (either when
a maintainer objects to an inclusion, or a regression discovered after
a kernel was released) was on par (and even lower) than the one for
"regular" patches tagged for stable.

What I didn't account for correctly was that people are way more
busier than I have expected, so a lot of these mails were lost or
ignored in mailboxes, so some of these patches never received review
before going in a stable tree.

I'm trying to fix this with a different approach (more below).

About half a year ago. I'm not sure about the no visibility part -
maintainers and authors would receive at least 3 mails for each patch
that got in this way, and would have at least a week (usually a lot
more) to object to the inclusion. Did you not receive any mails from
me?

I'll be winding down what I'm trying to do now, and will be trying to
address these concerns from maintainers in a few different ways.

I've started working on a framework to automate reviews of sent
patches to lkml by my framework, this will allow me to do the
following:

 - I would send a reply to the original patch sent to LKML within a
few hours for patches that have a high probability for being a bug fix
rather than sending a brand new mail a few months after this patch
made it upstream. This will help reviews as this commit is still fresh
in the author+maintainers head.
 - I will include the results of builds for various build testing (I
got that working now). At this point I suspect this will mostly help
Greg with patches that are already sent with stable tags.
 - This will turn into an opt-in rather than opt-out, but it will be
extremely easy to opt in (something like replying with "ack" to have
that patch included in the proposed stable branches).
 - In the future, I'd also like to create a per-subsystem testing
procedure (so for example, for xfs - run xfstest). I'll try working
with maintainers of each subsystem to create something they're happy
with. Given this discussion, I'll make XFS my first attempt at this :)

The mails will look something like this (an example based on a recent
XFS commit):

If you look at the recent history for fs/xfs, there were no commits in
the past half a year or so that were submitted to any stable tree in
the "traditional" way. There are no XFS fixes in the 4.14 LTS tree
besides the ones submitted with the autoselection method. This is not
finger pointing at XFS, but rather at the -stable process itself. It's
difficult to keep track on which branches authors need to test their
patches on, what sort of tests they need to do, and how they should
tag their commits. In quite a few cases the effort to properly tag a
commit for stable takes more effort that writing the code for that
commit, which deters people from working with stable.

Thanks again for your input.
