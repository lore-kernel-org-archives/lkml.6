Hi Eric,

Thanks for your detailed reply.

My english is not quite well, I could not type logically and quickly like you and could use some words improperly,
I just want to express my personal concern, please understand, thanks. :)

I think you mean the hash area?
Yes, I understand your design. It is a wonderful job for ext4/f2fs for now as Ted said.

I think it could not be as simple as you said for all cases.

If some fs submits contiguous access with different MAPPING (something like mixed FILE_MAPPING and META_MAPPING),
their page->index are actually unreliable(could be logical page index for FILE_MAPPING,and physical page index for META_MAPPING),
and data are organized by design in multi bios for a fs-specific use (such as compresssion).

You couldn't do such verification `if the page is above i_size' and it could be hard to integrate somehow.

Yes, for the current user ext4 and f2fs, it is absolutely wonderful.


I have to admit I am curious about Google fs-verity roadmap for the future Android
(I have to identify whether it is designed to replace dm-verity, currently I think is no)

since it is very important whether our EROFS should support fs-verity or not in the near future...


I could give some EROFS use case if you have some time to discuss.

EROFS uses a more aggressive inline approach, which means it not only inline data for small files.
It is designed to inline the last page, which are reasonable small (eg. only a few byte) to inline for all files, eg.

                                                                 IN FILE_MAPPING
IN META_MAPPING                                                  blk-aligned
+--------------------------------------|                         +--------+--------+     +----------+.......+
|inode A+inlined-last data.. inode B...|                         | page 0 | page 1 | ... | page n-1 . page n.
+--------------------------------------+                         +--------+--------+     +----------+.......+
         |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\

In priciple, this approach could be also used for read-write file systems to save more storage space.
I think it is still easy for uncompressed file if you do the zero padding as you said below.

But if considering _compression_.....especially compression in VLE, I think it should not rely on `bio' directly, because,
1) endio with compressed data rather than FILE_MAPPING plain data, these pages which could from META_MAPPING
(for caching compressed page on purpose) or FILE_MAPPING(for decompressing in-place to save redundant META_MAPPING memory).

I think it should be decompress at first and then fs-verity, but there could be more filepages other than compresssed pages joined
(eg. 128kb->32kb, we submit 8 pages but decompress end with 32 pages), it should not be the original bio any more...
(actually I think it is not the bio concept anymore...)

2) EROFS VLE is more complicated, we could end a bio with a compressed page but decompress a partial file page, eg.
    +-------------------+--------------------+
... | compressed page X |compressed page X+1 |
    +-------------------|--------------------+
            end of bio Y/     bio Y+1
                 \      |      /
                  +-------------------------+
                  |   plain data (file page)|
                  +-------------------------+
which means a bio could only decompress partial data of a page, the page could be Uptodate by two bios rather than one,
I have no idea how to fs-verity like this...

`it could call fsverity after assembling the page in the page cache.` as Ted said in that case.

Yes, after I just thinked over, I think there should be a zero padding to a block boundary
as you said due to Uptodate and mmap scenerio if you directly use its inode(file) mapping for verification.

OK, I got it.

I have to look into that and think over again. Thanks for your reply again in the end. :)
