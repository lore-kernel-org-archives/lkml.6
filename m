Yeah, I think that might do the job.

Yeah, I think this is much better.

(For container usecases, but not for a web server that uses AT_BENEATH.)

You're doing this check before actually looking up the parent, right?
So as long as I don't trigger the "path_equal(&nd->path, &nd->root)"
check that you do for O_BENEATH, escaping up by one level is possible,
right? You should probably move this check so that it happens after
following "..".

(Also: I assume that you're going to get rid of that memory allocation
in a future version.)

Same problem as in the RCU case above.
