Subject: [RFC PATCH 0/3] Documentation/features: Provide and apply "features-refresh.sh"

In Ingo's words [1]:

  "[...]  what should be done instead is to write a script that refreshes
   all the arch-support.txt files in-place. [...]

   It's OK for the script to have various quirks for weirdly implemented
   features and exceptions: i.e. basically whenever it gets a feature wrong,
   we can just tweak the script with quirks to make it all work out of box.

   [...]  But in the end there should only be a single new script:

     Documentation/features/scripts/features-refresh.sh

   ... which operates on the arch-support.txt files and refreshes them in
   place, and which, after all the refreshes have been committed, should
   produce an empty 'git diff' result."

  "[...]  New features can then be added by basically just creating a
   header-only arch-support.txt file, such as:

     triton:~/tip/Documentation/features> cat foo/bar/arch-support.txt
     #
     # Feature name:          shiny new fubar kernel feature
     #         Kconfig:       ARCH_USE_FUBAR
     #         description:   arch supports the fubar feature
     #

   And running Documentation/features/scripts/features-refresh.sh would
   auto-generate the arch support matrix. [...]
 
   This way we soft- decouple the refreshing of the entries from the
   introduction of the features, while still making it all easy to keep
   sync and to extend."

This RFC presents a first attempt to implement such a feature/script, and
applies it script on top of Arnd's:

  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/arnd/asm-generic.git arch-removal

Patch 1/3 provides the "features-refresh.sh" script.  Patch 2/3 removes the
"BPF-JIT" feature file and it creates header-only files for "cBPF-JIT" and
"eBPF-JIT".  Patch 3/3 presents the results of running the script; this run
also printed to standard output the following warnings:

  WARNING: '__HAVE_ARCH_STRNCASECMP' is not a valid Kconfig
  WARNING: 'Optimized asm/rwsem.h' is not a valid Kconfig
  WARNING: '!ARCH_USES_GETTIMEOFFSET' is not a valid Kconfig
  WARNING: '__HAVE_ARCH_PTE_SPECIAL' is not a valid Kconfig

(I'm sending these patches with empty commit messagges, for early feedback:
 I'll fill in these messages in subsequent versions if this makes sense...)

Cheers,
  Andrea
