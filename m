To be honest, I tend to agree with you. Therefore, after a few words
with Michael, v5 gets rid of those obscure wrappers to come back to the 
initial (v1) approach which was to use 'if (SLICE_NUM_HIGH)'.
Behind the fact that it in my mind looks cleared in the code than using 
slice_bitmap_xxx() wrappers, it also has the advantage of significantly 
reducing the size of the patch, which is a must to be able to get it 
applied on stable.
