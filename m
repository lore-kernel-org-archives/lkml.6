Sorry, one thing I forgot to mention about returning descriptors that
can only look up files beneath it -- while I think this would be very
useful, I'd be worried about jumping into chroot(2) territory where now
you are giving userspace the opportunity to try to create nested
"beneathfds" and so on. I do think it would be quite useful and
interesting though, but I'm not entirely sure how doable it would be
with the current namei infrastructure.
