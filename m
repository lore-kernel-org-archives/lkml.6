Except the current nvmem cells parsing code does not enforce that, and
existing DTs rely on this behavior, so we're screwed. Or are you
suggesting to add a new "bool check_cells_compat;" field to
nvmem_config?

No, just allow Bartosz to get his changes merged without waiting for you
and Srinivas to agree on how to handle the new binding. As I said
earlier, this mtd <-> nvmem stuff has been around for quite some time,
and instead of trying to find an approach that makes everyone happy, you
decided to let the patchset die.

nvmem-cells is a virtual concept too, still, you define them in the DT.

We don't resolve it back to the MTD device, because the MTD device is
just the parent of the nvmem device.

I'm not a big fan of this option either, but I thought I had to propose
it.

Yes, that's a workaround. And the reason I propose it, is, again,
because I don't want to block Bartosz.

I'm talking about partitions, and you're talking about mtd devices.
Right now partitions don't have subnodes, and if we define that
partition subnodes should describe nvmem-cells, then it becomes part of
the official binding. So, no, the problem you mention does not (yet)
exist.

But it's way more flexible than putting everything in the nvmem
framework. BTW, did you notice that nvmem-cells parsing does not work
with flashes bigger than 4GB, because the framework assumes
#address-cells and #size-cells are always 1. That's probably something
we'll have to fix for the MTD case.

Hm, how is that different? ->of_xlate() is just a way for drivers to
have their own DT representation, which is exactly what we want here.

If you like.

Except Srinivas was not happy with this solution, and this stalled the
discussion. I'm trying to find other options and you keep rejecting all
of them to come back to this one.

That's not true!!! What forces people to add this compatible in their
DT? Nothing. I'll tell you what will happen: people will start defining
their nvmem cells directly under the MTD node because that *works*, and
even if the binding is not documented and we consider it invalid, we'll
be stuck supporting it forever. As said above, the very reason for
option #1 to exist is to give you and Srinivas some more time to sort
this out, while unblocking Bartosz in the meantime.

So we're back to square 1, and you're again blocking everything because
you refuse to consider other options.

There's obviously nothing more I can do to help, and that's unfortunate
because other people are waiting for this feature.
