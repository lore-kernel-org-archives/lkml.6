True, but at the same time this feature is for "users with custom
hardware designed for purpose", I assume they would be willing to take
on the bus renumbering risk. It's already the case that
/sys/bus/pci/drivers/<x>/bind takes BDF, which is why it seemed to
make a similar interface for the command line. Ideally we could later
get something into ACPI or other platform firmware to arrange for
bridges to disable ACS by default if we see p2p becoming a
common-off-the-shelf feature. I.e. a BIOS switch to enable p2p in a
given PCI-E sub-domain.
