0? It's always implementation-defined. On Juno it seems to be always-0, but
other systems may behave differently. (Juno may generate another ESR value when
I'm not watching it...)

Just because we can't control the ESR doesn't mean injecting an SError isn't
something user-space may want to do.
If we tackle migration of pending-SError first, I think that will give us the
API to create a new pending SError with/without an ESR as appropriate.

(Not my suggestion, It was Andrew Jones idea.)

We would be re-using the struct to have values with slightly different meanings.
But for migration the upshot is the same, call KVM_GET_VCPU_EVENTS on one
system, and pass the struct to KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS on the new system. If we're
lucky Qemu may be able to do this in shared x86/arm64 code.

But that made the functionality of this patch: A new API to return -EINVAL from
the kernel.

Swapping the patches round would have avoided this.
Regardless, I think this will fold out in a rebase.


Thanks,
