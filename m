Well, yes. Doing it right (ofono, etc) is not that easy.

Ok.

Ok, lets ignore bluetooth for now. There is "normal" mode, and then
there's "call" mode, right? Where's "normal" mode configured?

Could we simply always configure the VOICE DAI in the call mode? Yes,
it would limit samplerates to 8 or 16k, but .. that's not too
important limitation for voice codec...?

Well, you'll still cause regressions when you change the dts, as
people will have wrong .config for new dts.
