I think we agree that, depending on what HW/SW driver manage
this PCI controller clocks, this driver may well become broken,
the driver itself has no idea what's behind the clock API and
can end up waiting for an event forever.

This does not leave me in a comfortable position to merge code that I
know has flaws.

I won't merge it for v4.21, I need more time (and feedback) to
understand what can be done to make this driver (and many others)
more robust.

Thanks,
Lorenzo
