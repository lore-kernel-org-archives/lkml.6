If it was not clear, I did not mean to have only 4 levels, keep all 15
same as there are 9 for zlib. The guildelines would be desirable and I
don't want to make decision for the user which level to pick. So we
don't disagree.

We'd need to observe that in practice before doing refinements, simpler
logic is better for the start.

There's some penalty caused by the allocation if there are no workspaces
at all, as the amount of memory is quite large for kernel.
This could stress the memory subsystem also because the memory has to be
either contiguous or vmalloced. As the memory is released soon, all the
work might need to be done again and again. So, more than one
preallocated workspace could be good but the number of levels does not
make it easy to choose which one.
