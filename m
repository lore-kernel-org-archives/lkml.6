OK, thanks for the explanation, I think I understand what's going on
now, correct me if I'm mistaken.  I added a hint about "PF" for Randy,
too.

These are on pci/virtualization for v4.18.

    PCI/IOV: Add pci_sriov_configure_simple()
    
    SR-IOV (Single Root I/O Virtualization) is an optional PCIe capability (see
    PCIe r4.0, sec 9).  A PCIe Function with the SR-IOV capability is referred
    to as a PF (Physical Function).  If SR-IOV is enabled on the PF, several
    VFs (Virtual Functions) may be created.  The VFs can be individually
    assigned to virtual machines, which allows them to share a single hardware
    device while being isolated from each other.
    
    Some SR-IOV devices have resources such as queues and interrupts that must
    be set up in the PF before enabling the VFs, so they require a PF driver to
    do that.
    
    Other SR-IOV devices don't require any PF setup before enabling VFs.  Add a
    pci_sriov_configure_simple() interface so PF drivers for such devices can
    use it without repeating the VF-enabling code.

    PCI/IOV: Add pci-pf-stub driver for PFs that only enable VFs
    
    Some SR-IOV PF devices provide no functionality other than acting as a
    means of enabling VFs.  For these devices, we want to enable the VFs and
    assign them to guest virtual machines, but there's no need to have a driver
    for the PF itself.
    
    Add a new pci-pf-stub driver to claim those PF devices and provide the
    generic VF enable functionality.  An administrator can use the sysfs
    "sriov_numvfs" file to enable VFs, then assign them to guests.
    
    For now I only have one example ID provided by Amazon in terms of devices
    that require this functionality.  The general idea is that in the future we
    will see other devices added as vendors come up with devices where the PF
    is more or less just a lightweight shim used to allocate VFs.
