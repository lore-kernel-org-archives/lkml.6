Well if the VBUS line is not connected the PMIC is muxed
to USB carkit mode so the lines go to the UART on the SoC
through some level shifter. If it works it should not cause
any issues, the symptoms I saw earlier was corrupted UART
console and noticed that what worked best for me was 3.3V
ftdi based devices out of the collection of random pl2303
and ftdi cables I had around.

I guess somebody could try to measure the uart lines with
a scope with nothing connected and sending out data from
droid 4. Or look at the carkit spec for the UART voltage
levels.

Tony
