Nice! I see no updates on this progress, but it would seem this
may then mean this cannot be merged until the release after?

There's a discussion over having security_kernel_read_file(NULL,
READING_WHATEVER) become another LSM hook. So your series would conflict with
that at the moment.

So yet another piece of code which this series depends on.
