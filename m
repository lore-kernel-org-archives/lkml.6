I think you mean 1/127, not 1/129.

I think this ioctl is the start of the disagreement.  How about this
strawman:

verity_fd = ioctl(fd, FS_IOC_VERITY_FD);
write(verity_fd, &merkle_tree);
close(verity_fd);

At final close of that verity_fd, the filesystem behaves in the same way
that it does on receipt of this FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY ioctl today.

Should this ioctl be better implemented as an xattr?

That makes sense; the filesystem can't verify the data before presenting
it to userspace if it's being copied directly into userspace.

> +- DAX (Direct Access) is not supported on verity files.

That makes less sense.  The kernel can check the checksum before
copying the data to the user.  Is this simply a current limitation of
the implementation?

I think you mean "all but the deepest"?
