I was more referring to future stuff, but yes. I find it a bit easier
to handle than having to switch the sockopt too and so far I couldn't
find drawbacks to it.

That is, when using a new sockopt, we could accept a buffer larger
than the needed, but I'm not considering that as a valid point
anymore. Putting this compatibility aside for a moment, that pretty
much means the user doesn't know what it wants and so we also don't.

That's exactly what I tried to mean. :-)

We can't do that on setsockopt calls, as optlen is R/O there.

I also need to dig deeper on this, but in general what if we draw
a line based on the current implementation:
- Current struct is X bytes long
- Patch current and older kernels to accept up to X bytes, as long as
  the trailing bytes are zeroed. Otherwise, EINVAL.
  X may be a magic number for old kernel, but this way we avoid
  unbounded buffers and the limit is not random.
- On further changes, create a new, explicitly versioned struct.
  Older kernels will EINVAL if this new struct is used, which is
  expected.
  Newer kernels will then have to cope with the different
  sizes/structs accordingly.
