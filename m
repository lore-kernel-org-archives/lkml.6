Not really except that no one has complained. The very first swapping
code that I implemented used a VMA as backing storage. I could take
pieces of that code to replace shmem specifics. The difference was that
the driver did vm_mmap(). Now that you suggested the above I wonder how
it did not came to mind back then to provide the VMA as parameter.

A single buffer that can hold both PCMD entries and swapped pages in its
address space would probably be the  best way to do it. I would add that
as a field to struct sgx_enclave_create. If we want the kill-behavior,
you could signal that with a NULL value.
