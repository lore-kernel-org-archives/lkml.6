In the worth case there is no performance, so it will not hurt having it.
However depending the compiler and the platform this can bring some improvement.
For instance like Jingoo said: "The most platforms using 'dwc' are based on ARM
CPUs. So, the shift rotation can be better."

It's just a attempt to improve the code that doesn't bring any harm.

Personally I prefer the shift rotation rather the division by 2. But in my case
I'm used to use/see this type of operation, but it's like I said it's my
personal opinion.

Let's see this patch inflicts pain on someone else, in that case I'll remove
from the series.
