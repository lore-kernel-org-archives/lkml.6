It's very similar to KVM's model, which has proven to be fairly robust,
so I don't think it'll be an unholy mess (famous last words).  It
probably won't be a "great" cleanup per se, but it definitely should
make the code more maintainable in the long run.

The other interesting aspect of the enclave fd approach is that it would
allow userspace to *execute* an enclave from multiple processes, so long
as it did the necessary multiplexing of pthreads to enclave threads.  I
think SGX2 instructions (dynamic EPC management) would even allow adding
new enclave threads on-demand.
