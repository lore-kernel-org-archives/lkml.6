In the long term, once we get IOMMU grouping callbacks to VMs we can look at extending p2pdma in this way. But I don't think this is viable for the initial series.

Alex:
Really? IOMMU groups are created by the kernel, so don't know how they would be passed into the VMs, unless indirectly via  PCI(e) layout.
At best, twiddling w/ACS enablement (emulation) would cause VMs to see different IOMMU groups, but again, VMs are not the security point/level, the host/HV's are.
