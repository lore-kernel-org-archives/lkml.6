Uhm, can you just type git revert 882164a4a928? :)
Or do I have to send you a pull request?

Yes, I understand that pinging people can be annoying and time
consuming. But we have tools like patchwork. Why isn't pinging
(semi)automated? Patchwork should really track the review status of a
patch.
I think the concept of no-comments =3D everything-ok is
fundamentally broken. But it has always been that way for wireless and
lots of other subsystems.
