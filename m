Maybe your code is ok then. If the stats show up in /proc/interrupts 
then you can see it moving to different cores.

Yeah I'm not sure what to do about it either as I'm not super familiar 
with that area either. Just making note of what I encountered. And you 
are right, the updated info has to go over NTB for the other side to 
write to the updated place. So there's a lot of latency involved.
