Printing what bits diverged would be helpful in the unlikely event that the
WARN_ONCE triggers.  "cr4 bypass attempt" is probably only meaningful to
people that are already familiar with the code, e.g.:

	if (WARN_ONCE((val & cr4_pin) != cr4_pin,
	    "Attempt to unpin cr4 bits: %lx, cr4 bypass attack?!", ~val & cr4_pin))
