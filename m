I was hoping to avoid a quirk because AFAIK all Intel parts have this
issue so it will be an ongoing maintenance issue.  I tried to avoid
the timeout delays, e.g., with 40b960831cfa ("PCI: pciehp: Compute
timeout from hotplug command start time").

But we still see the alarming messages, so we should probably add a
quirk to get rid of those.

But I haven't given up on the idea of getting rid of the
pciehp_remove() path.  I'm not convinced yet that we actually need to
do anything to shut this device down.  I don't like the assumption
that kexec requires this.  The kexec is fundamentally just a branch,
and anything we do before the branch (i.e., in the old kernel), we
should also be able to do after the branch (i.e., in the kexec-ed
kernel).
