Hi,

This series provides the script 'features-refresh.sh', which operates on
the arch support status files, and it applies this script to refresh the
status files in place; previous discussions about this series are at [1].

The series is organized as follows.

  - Patch 1/6 adds the script to 'Documentation/features/scripts/'.

  - Patch 2/6 presents the results of running the script; this run
    also printed the messages

       WARNING: 'HAVE_BPF_JIT' is not a valid Kconfig
       WARNING: '__HAVE_ARCH_STRNCASECMP' is not a valid Kconfig
       WARNING: 'Optimized asm/rwsem.h' is not a valid Kconfig
       WARNING: '__HAVE_ARCH_PTE_SPECIAL' is not a valid Kconfig

    to standard output.

  - Patches 3-6/6 fix each of these warnings.

(Applies on today's mainline.)

Cheers,
  Andrea

Changes in v2:
  - support negation operators in Kconfig (suggested by Ingo Molnar)
  - reorder patches 2/6 and 3/6 (suggested by Ingo Molnar)
  - add patches 4-6/6 (suggested by Ingo Molnar)
