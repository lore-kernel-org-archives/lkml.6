It's worth looking, but I don't understand how a BIOS switch would
solve this problem.  I assume that with the same BIOS settings,
Windows works and Linux fails.

Maybe there would be a clue in an acpidump from affected machines,
e.g., maybe we'd see some kind of ACPI hotplug notification.  That
seems like a long shot because we do have acpiphp in the kernel, and
it *should* be handling such notifications, but it could always be
broken.

The Windows device manager info (requested above) would be
interesting.
