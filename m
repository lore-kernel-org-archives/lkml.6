You got lucky.  Try creating an SB litmus test where, instead of an
smp_mb() fence between the write and the read, each thread executes
some other kind of fence.

The acyclicity condition should have been written more like this:

let po_ghb = ([R] ; po ; [M]) | ([M] ; po ; [W])

acyclic mfence | po_ghb | rf | fr | co as tso-mca

I don't know what the fence instruction is on s390; change the "mfence"
above accordingly.  The main difference between this and the
corresponding expression in x86tso.cat is that I replaced rfe with rf.

This doesn't account for atomic operations properly; see the "implied" 
term in x86tso.cat.
