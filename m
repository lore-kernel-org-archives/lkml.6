That doesn't actually test the default options that most users will
currently be using. It tests a new format relatively few people are
using in production, and the old format that people are slowly
moving away from. If you run mkfs.xfs without any options right now
you get

MKFS_OPTIONS='-m crc=1,reflink=0,rmapbt=0, -i sparse=0'

Yup, but the sorting out the results of the automated tests is the
part that takes all the developer time and resources, not the
running of the tests...

Assuming someone has the time to actually look at all these
problems....

I'm sure this was fixed. It's simply a case of having the code call
the release function rather than freeing the item it directly on
abort.

But I can't find the patch, commit, etc.

Ah, a drive-by bug fix back to the EFI code in January, didn't pass
review, was not followed up on with fixes required. Just posted a
patch to fix it.

Cheers,

Dave.
