Fair points, though this is rather what I meant by "sane essentials".
Because there are strict limits on what can be done in the vDSO, it may
be more bloat-resistant and more conservatively maintained.

This might provide a way to push some dumb compatibility kludge code
that receives little ongoing maintenance outside the privilege wall,
whereas it has to sit in the kernel proper today.

In theory we could opt to advertise new syscalls only via vDSO entry
points, and not maintain __NR_xxx values for them (which may or may
not upset ptrace users.)  Anyway, I digress...
