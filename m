I saw in the kernel-parameters.txt file that the isolcpus option was
deprecated - use cpusets instead. However, there doesn't seem to have
document on the right way to do it. Of course, we can achieve similar
results with what you have outlined above, but the process is more
complex than just adding another boot command line argument with
isolcpus. So I doubt isolcpus will die anytime soon unless we can make
the alternative as easy to use.

AFAIK, all the processes belong to the root cgroup on boot. And the root
cgroup is usually special that the controller may not exert any control
for processes in the root cgroup. Many controllers become active for
processes in the child cgroups only. Would you mind elaborating what
doesn't quite work currently?

I think the cpu_exclusive feature can be useful to enforce that CPUs
allocated to the "other" isolated cgroup cannot be used by the processes
under the "system" parent.

I know that there are special code to handle the isolcpus option. How
about changing it to create a exclusive cpuset automatically instead.
Applications that need to run in those isolated CPUs can then use the
standard cgroup process to be moved into the isolated cgroup. For example,

isolcpus=<cpuset-name>,<cpu-id-list>

or

isolcpuset=<cpuset-name>[,cpu:<cpu-id-list>][,mem:<memory-node-list>]

We can then retire the old usage and encourage users to use the cgroup
API to manage it.

Cheers,
Longman
