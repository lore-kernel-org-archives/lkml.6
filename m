True enough. We agree that this #ifdef is undesirable. And yet when I 
tried it, I found an unexpected readability benefit to your suggestion:

#ifdef CONFIG_SCSI_ESP_PIO
        u8 __iomem              *fifo_reg;
        int                     send_cmd_error;
        u32                     send_cmd_residual;
#endif

This grouping does help convey the purpose of these struct members, even 
though the #ifdef is meant for the compiler not for the human reader.

So maybe it makes sense to group these definitions (they are all the same 
size):

        /* These are used by esp_scsi_send_pio_cmd() */
        u8 __iomem              *fifo_reg;
        int                     send_cmd_error;
        u32                     send_cmd_residual;

Do static checkers really complain about this? I think the validity of an 
extern can't be known until the final linkage is done.

At that point the checker may complain that no compilation unit references 
a symbol in a header.

But this would lead to false positives where a header file is shared by 
separate programs which share library code but not macros.
