I'm looking at the generic binding again, and it seems we never quite
managed to fix
some minor problems with it. See below for a possible way to clarify it.

In the suggested patch below, I have documented one "rst" line that is used to
reset the ufshcd device. The second reset line as I understand now is used in
a rather nonstandard way and gets asserted only while setting up the additional
registers for your glue logic, so that one seems better left documented in your
own binding.

I've added a "jedec,ufshci-3.0" compatible string, which appears to be
the latest
version of the ufshci itself, and I've documented four clocks that are
already used
by the qualcomm variant of the platform device. Please have a look at the below,
and see if we need additional changes or clarifications. With this, most of your
binding can get folded into the common document, so you just need to explain
the private compatible string, the larger register area, and the
additional reset line.
