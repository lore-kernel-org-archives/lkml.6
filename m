This sounds generally reasonable.

It is not adequate for describing changing the tag on already-tagged
memory (which a memory allocator will definitely do), but we may be able
to come up with some weasel words to cover that.

It is also not adequete for describing tagging (and retagging) regions
of the stack -- but as you say, we can rule that use-case out for now
in the interest of simplicity, since we know we wouldn't be able to
deploy it widely for now anyway due to the incompability with non-MTE-
capable hardware.


Ideally we would clarify user/kernel interface semantics in terms of
object and pointer lifetimes and accessibility, but that's a larger
project that should be pursued separately (if at all).

I could also quibble about whether "anonymous mmap" is the right thing
here -- we should still give specific examples of things that do / don't
qualify, to make it clear what we mean.
