This sounds reasonable to me.

If you do it this way, these exception handlers would have to chain,
with an API convention that you're obligated to always ask for
resumption of signal delivery if you don't recognize the address,
right? Kind of like a notifier chain. (Except that, unless this is
implemented in the vDSO, each notifier invocation would cross the
kernel-user boundary twice.)

Why would that have to be a syscall? For signal handlers registered
with SA_NODEFER, you can basically leave the signal handler with a
longjmp, right?

I like this direction more, although I'm not sure whether the table
the kernel sees should be at instruction-level granularity. Perhaps
you could associate an exception handler with a VMA? Any instruction
that faults in the VMA triggers the fault handler?
