If the clocksource depends on a driver rather than a feature of the
architecture,
this may not be worth optimizing though, so maybe leave it as it is for now.

Can you explain? What is it that makes them all incompatible?

This is still relatively easy to fix, you just need a cpu specific loop
that uses the actual line size rather than the maximum size.

On many architectures, we detect the offsets at boot time and pass
them as variables. On
ARM, we go as far as patching the kernel at boot time to have constant
offsets, but usually
it's not worth the effort.

It sounds like your GPIO driver should get fixed to use irq domains right,
it should not be too hard. The number of GPIOs is typically a compile
time constant today, but we also try to turn it into a dynamic allocation
that we have for IRQs on most targets.

What I meant here is that you can get the same behavior by
appending the dtb to the kernel rather than linking it into the
kernel. The reason for preferring the appended one is that you
can more easily use the same kernel binary across boards with
different bootloaders.

I'd say it's better to get rid of it for the upstream port, more importantly
getting rid of the code that checks for this symbol. Usually what happens
with version checks like this one is that they get out of sync quickly
as a new kernel version does things differently and diverges more
from the old release you were comparing against. In device drivers,
we tend to remove all those checks.

You can also use the cc-ifversion Makefile macro to apply it on
the old compiler. That way you can still use gcc-4.5 as long as
that remains relevant but don't get worse code generation on
modern versions.

Ok. Generally speaking, architectures that don't allow unaligned access
should have all code built in a way that uses aligned access (gcc normally
falls back to byte access when it encounters an unaligned pointer at
compile time), but if this is just for old CPUs that are not used in future
products, having the fixup does sound simpler, as it allows you to still
run new binaries on the old machines. I haven't looked at the implementation
for the fixup here, but I remember the same thing from the nds32 port.
In that case, we ended up keeping the fixup as an option for old
user space, but disabled to softalign fixups for kernel code. Can you do
the same thing here?
