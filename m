Yes.  In fact it's used for FIPS certification testing.

You can never break things by introducing new algorithms.  The
problem is only when you remove existing ones.

Sure, nobody sane should be doing it.  But when it comes to
government certification... :)

Even without the issue of replacing chacha20-generic with
chacha20-zinc which breaks point 1 above, we simply don't want
or need to go through zinc's run-time implementation choice for
the crypto API algorithms.  They've already paid for the indirect
function call so why make them go through yet another run-time
branch?

If the optics of having the code in crypto is the issue, we could
move the actual algorithm code into a third location, perhaps
arch/x86/crypto/lib or arch/x86/lib/crypto.  Then both zinc and
the crypto API can sit on top of that.

Cheers,
