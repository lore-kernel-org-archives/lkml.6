I think the origin rules have to apply too: [vvar] is not a regular,
private page but a weird, shared thing mapped for you by the kernel.

Presumably userspace _cannot_ do mprotect(PROT_WRITE) on it.

I'm also assuming that userspace cannot recolour memory in read-only
pages.  That sounds bad if there's no way to prevent it.

Fair enough, I'm a bit hazy on the details as of right now..

To implement enforceable protection, or as a diagnostic tool for when
something goes wrong?

In the latter case it's still OK for the kernel's tag checking not to be
exhaustive.

Check all granules of a massive DMA buffer?

That doesn't sounds feasible without explicit support in the hardware to
have the DMA check tags itself as the memory is accessed.  MTE by itself
doesn't provide for this IIUC (at least, it would require support in the
platform, not just the CPU).

We do not want to bake any assumptions into the ABI about whether a
given data transfer may or may not be offloaded to DMA.  That feels
like a slippery slope.

Providing we get the checks for free in put_user/get_user/
copy_{to,from}_user(), those will cover a lot of cases though, for
non-bulk-IO cases.


My assumption has been that at this point in time we are mainly aiming
to support the debug/diagnostic use cases today.

At least, those are the low(ish)-hanging fruit.

Others are better placed than me to comment on the goals here.
