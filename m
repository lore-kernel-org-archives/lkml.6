Subject: [PATCH V2 2/5] mm/hugetlb: Distinguish between migratability and movability
Date:   Fri, 12 Oct 2018 09:29:56 +0530

During huge page allocation it's migratability is checked to determine if
it should be placed under movable zones with GFP_HIGHUSER_MOVABLE. But the
movability aspect of the huge page could depend on other factors than just
migratability. Movability in itself is a distinct property which should not
be tied with migratability alone.

This differentiates these two and implements an enhanced movability check
which also considers huge page size to determine if it is feasible to be
placed under a movable zone. At present it just checks for gigantic pages
but going forward it can incorporate other enhanced checks.
