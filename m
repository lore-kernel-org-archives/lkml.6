Ouch! You're right. I'll fix this for v3 by comparing against 1.

There is one more issue that was bugging me. If next() fails at the 
discovery0 step, or at steps[0], in both cases the error message will say 
step 0 failed. But as it's just a pr_debug message, the function address 
is included and I don't see a short and nice solution (should I report the 
steps as starting from 1? but that might be confusing; or a different 
string? sounds like not worth it), I kept it that way.

But if someone thinks this is worth improving, please let me know.
