That's fine, my worry is more that you are already saying too much
by describing a behavior for ioremap_wc+relaxed+barrier that is
neither a good idea or guaranteed to do what you describe.

I would say we should strengthen the behavior of outX() where possible.
I don't know if arm64 actually has a way of doing that, my understanding
earlier was that the AXI bus was already posted, so there is not much
you can do here to define __io_paw() in a way that will prevent posted
writes.

Fair enough.
