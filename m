Some drivers are already doing something similar by overriding the DMA
mask again in ->enable_dma(). I had briefly considered doing that for
Tegra, but after thinking about it, it just became clear to me that we
shouldn't need to override this in every driver. I just don't think it's
correct for the MMC core to muck with the DMA mask. Just because the
hardware supports the SDHCI 64-bit addressing mode doesn't mean that all
64 bits can be addressed by the hardware. The DMA mask defines what the
valid address range is for the device and it's already conventional for
drivers to set this early in their ->probe() implementation (or have the
bus set it up). It seems wasteful to have to redo that in a custom
callback.
