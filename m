The hotplug (and, I guess, the DLLSCE interrupt) and PME interrupts
are the same INTx wire or MSI vector.  But I guess we know the
interrupt here must really be a PME because pcie_pme_irq() reads
PCI_EXP_RTSTA_PME and does nothing unless it is set.

Interesting that Hot-Plug Interrupt Enable by itself doesn't seem to
gate the DLLSCE notification.  Sec 6.7.3.4 says Hot-Plug Interrupt
Enable is a master enable/disable bit for "all hot-plug events".  It's
not completely explicit about what "all hot-plug events" includes, but
DLLSCE is definitely included in the list in sec 6.7.3.

I don't think the bugzilla from Heiner below is actually related to
*this* patch.  Heiner's system doesn't have the topology above.

If you have a report for a system where the immediate wakeup happens,
i.e., something with the topology above, I'd be interested in
including that report here.  Ideally it would have complete lspci
info.  I'm just wondering if this is actually a defect in the switch.
