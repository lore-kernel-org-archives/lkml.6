These two patches will be fine in that regard.  They aren't in the area
where all the syzkaller bugs have been getting fixed.  But I need to
merge for-rc into for-next because of all of the syzkaller bugs being
fixed.  We are running into a situation where code updates that were
planned are in areas where syzkaller bugs have been fixed and there
would be significant merge conflicts if I didn't.  So, the plan as it
stands is: get the needed patches in for-rc, merge for-rc to for-next,
then cherry pick from for-next to for-rc just the two patches here
(since I have no idea how cherry picking to for-rc and then merging for-
rc to for-next would play out, I'm just not gonna try it).

It's a bit convoluted, but as long as I don't use my standard git
request pull macro when generating the pull request (it will pick the
wrong merge base every time whenever you've merged for-rc into for-next,=
=20
you have to manually find the alternate merge base and use the right one
for git request pull) it comes out nicely in the end.
