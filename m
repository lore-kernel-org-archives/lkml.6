Umm, don't think this is that similar to daxctl() discussion. We are not
speaking about providing any new userspace API for this. Also I think the
situation about leases has somewhat cleared up with this discussion - ODP
hardware does not need leases since it can use MMU notifiers, for non-ODP
hardware it is difficult to handle leases as such hardware has only one big
kill-everything call and using that would effectively mean lot of work on
the userspace side to resetup everything to make things useful if workable
at all.

So my proposal would be:

1) ODP hardward uses gup_fast() like direct IO and uses MMU notifiers to do
its teardown when fs needs it.

2) Hardware not capable of tearing down pins from MMU notifiers will have
to use gup_longterm() (we may actually rename it to a more suitable name).
FS may just refuse such calls (for normal page cache backed file, it will
just return success but for DAX file it will do sanity checks whether the
file is fully allocated etc. like we currently do for swapfiles) but if
gup_longterm() returns success, it will provide the same guarantees as for
swapfiles. So the only thing that we need is some call from gup_longterm()
to a filesystem callback to tell it - this file is going to be used by a
third party as an IO buffer, don't touch it. And we can (and should)
probably refactor the handling to be shared between swapfiles and
gup_longterm().
