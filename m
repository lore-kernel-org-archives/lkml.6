I think the first five are good to go, but that's your call.

Patches 1-4 are the API reworked following your suggestions.

Patch 5 (SPDX) = I haven't heard any feedback on, but I think it's good.

So I think patches 1-5 are good (if you agree).  The rest are new to
the mailing list and haven't been reviewed/acked by anybody else yet.

I generally avoid posting reviewed/unreviewed patches together, sorry.
I just didn't want to open the possibility of patches being applied
out of order and the issues that can cause.
