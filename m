So disabling CONFIG_NVME_MULTIPATH isn't adequate?  You see a need for
enabling CONFIG_NVME_MULTIPATH but disallowing consideration of ANA
state management for these embedded cases?  That doesn't make much sense
in that ANA won't be enabled on the target, and if it is then shouldn't
the NVMe host enable ANA support?

In a later mail you clarified that by "second" you meant the sysfs
export.

nvme_ns_id_attrs_are_visible() calls nvme_ctrl_use_ana() to know whether
to export the ana state via sysfs.  Makes no sense to enable ANA to
work, independent of native multipathing, and then even though ANA is
active disallow exporting the associated ANA state.  We need
consistency.. if the sysfs file exists it means ANA state is being
managed.

All I can figure is that what you're suggesting is born out of
disallowing uses you fundamentally disagree with (e.g. multipath-tools
reading the ANA state from this sysfs file).
