I don't agree that the legacy copying behavior is because the buffer is
"untrusted". The buffer is the user's data, there's no trust issue here.
If the user application modifies the buffer while it's being sent, it's
a violation of the API contract, and the only victim is the application
itself. Same applies for receiving data. And as pointed out, most all
storage layers, file and block both, use this strategy for direct i/o.

Regarding signing, if the application alters the data then the integrity
hash will simply do its job and catch the application in the act. Again,
nothing suffers but the application.

Regarding encryption, I assume you're proposing to encrypt and decrypt
the data in a kernel buffer, effectively a copy. So in fact, in the
encryption case there's no need to pin and map the user buffer at all.

I'll mention however that Windows takes the path of not performing
RDMA placement when encrypting data. It saves nothing, and even adds
some overhead, because of the need to touch the buffer anyway to
manage the encryption/decryption.

Bottom line - no security implication for using user buffers directly.

> I also want to point out that, I choose to implement .read_iter and .write_iter from file_operations to implement direct I/O (CIFS is already doing this for O_DIRECT, so following this code path will avoid a big mess up).  The ideal choice is to implement .direct_IO from address_space_operations that I think eventually we want to move to.
