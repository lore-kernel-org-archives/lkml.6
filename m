You can/should change it - patchwork doesn't really track this at all
anyway.

Hmm? Why would that be required? __ro_after_init works fine in modules?

Come to think of it, the typical order here would be 1,2,5.5,11,6,12,24
(6<->11), due to the ordering in the probe request frame I guess.

I'm not sure it matters though.

These can be const, I think?

I think you should avoid ** - it's the kernel-doc marker.

If this is the reason for not allowing it to be a module then you don't
need  to disallow the module case.

Not sure I see much value in the union, but I don't think it matters
much.
(You could just cast below - (void *)&ssid, sizeof(ssid))

Do you need the rtnl for the priv->scan_request locking?

I think Sergey pointed out the -60 elsewhere - need to check here too,
and maybe set in some place that you actually report dBm/mBm.

Also, I think you should only report something here if actually
connected - Sergey pointed this out on the dump station but it applies
here too.

this is called from

the destructor, but I believe the destructor is invoked with the RTNL
held. As such, this will deadlock (and lockdep should complain - at
least in current kernel versions) when it's actually running when you
flush it, since you flush something that's (potentially) waiting to
acquire the RTNL, but you are holding the RTNL here and so neither side
can make progress.

Maybe we should fix/change that?
