So, uh, what happens if the filesystem is so full that you run out of
space for stashing old block contents?

Also, what happens with things like ext4 that don't send discard
requests for uninitialized blockgroups and blockgroups that haven't been
touched since the last FITRIM call?

Or filesystems with 512b blocks?

Hmm.  I guess it's neat how you can discard the old fs simply by copying
the SECTOR0_CURRENT to sector 0 and exiting.

ext4 writes its superblock 512 bytes into the disk (so you can cram a
x86 boot sector and an ext4 fs into a floopy drive!) which means that a
bowed (bow'd?) block device will have both the bow log at byte offset 0
and a ext4 superblock at byte offset 512...?
