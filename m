Hi,

This is an important UPDATE to the previous LSF/MM announcement:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/51b4b263-a0f2-113d-7bdc-f7960b540929@kernel.dk/

A BPF track will join the annual LSF/MM Summit this year! Please read
the updated description and CFP information below.

It will be held from April 30 - May 2 at the Sheraton Puerto Rico Hotel &
Casino Lodges in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
LSF/MM is an invitation-only technical workshop to map out improvements to
the Linux storage, filesystem, memory management, and bpf subsystems that
will make their way into the mainline kernel within the coming years.

https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linux-storage-filesystem-mm-summit-2019/

LSF/MM 2019 will be a three day, stand-alone conference with three
subsystem-specific tracks, cross-track discussions, as well as BoF and
hacking sessions.

On behalf of the committee I am issuing a call for agenda proposals
that are suitable for cross-track discussion as well as technical
subjects for the breakout sessions.

If advance notice is required for visa applications then please point
that out in your proposal or request to attend, and submit the topic
as soon as possible.

1) Proposals for agenda topics should be sent before February 22th,
2019 to:

	lsf-pc@lists.linux-foundation.org

and CC the mailing lists that are relevant for the topic in question:

	FS:	linux-fsdevel@vger.kernel.org
	MM:	linux-mm@kvack.org
	Block:	linux-block@vger.kernel.org
	ATA:	linux-ide@vger.kernel.org
	SCSI:	linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org
	NVMe:	linux-nvme@lists.infradead.org
        BPF:    bpf@vger.kernel.org

Note that we have extended the original deadline by a week, to
accommodate the late arrival of the BPF track.

Please tag your proposal with [LSF/MM TOPIC] to make it easier to
track. In addition, please make sure to start a new thread for each
topic rather than following up to an existing one. Agenda topics and
attendees will be selected by the program committee, but the final
agenda will be formed by consensus of the attendees on the day.

2) Requests to attend the summit for those that are not proposing a
topic should be sent to:

	lsf-pc@lists.linux-foundation.org

Please summarize what expertise you will bring to the meeting, and
what you would like to discuss. Please also tag your email with
[LSF/MM ATTEND] and send it as a new thread so there is less chance of
it getting lost.

We will try to cap attendance at around 25-30 per track to facilitate
discussions although the final numbers will depend on the room sizes
at the venue. Note that BPF track will be limited to 10-15 attendees.

For discussion leaders, slides and visualizations are encouraged to
outline the subject matter and focus the discussions. Please refrain
from lengthy presentations and talks; the sessions are supposed to be
interactive, inclusive discussions.

In particular BPF topics are encouraged to be storage, fs, mm, tracing,
security related or advancing the state of the art of BPF core.
BPF and networking related topics are recommended to be submitted for
Linux Plumbers Conference and corresponding Networking and BPF microconf
later this year.

Thank you on behalf of the program committee:

	Anna Schumaker (Filesystems)
	Josef Bacik (Filesystems)
	Martin K. Petersen (Storage)
	Jens Axboe (Storage)
	Michal Hocko (MM)
	Rik van Riel (MM)
	Johannes Weiner (MM)
        Alexei Starovoitov (BPF)
