Hi Vignesh,

thank you for explaining. To me - this looks like it is better to write
a separate IRQ chip implementation for DRA7XX, let's face it this patch
is a bit hackish (and will prevent us from removing dw_handle_msi_irq()
altogether - which is something we want to achieve) and it is clutching
at straws to re-use DWC MSI code but honestly it is a bit of stretch.

This would duplicate some code, yes but on the other hand it would
give you full control of the (DWC) HW.

You can have a look at pcie-tango.c or the mobiveil patches I have
just reviewed:

https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/878494/

Please note Gustavo's reworked DWC MSI handling that is now queued
for v4.17 in my pci/dwc-msi branch - please do have a look at it
too (and if Gustavo has comments they are welcome).

I do not like the current implementation - sorry, we have to come
up with something cleaner, I do not think that's so complicated.

I do not mind reviewing intermediate patches as long as we get to
a cleaner solution.

Thanks,
Lorenzo
