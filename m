Hi Cody,

Sorry for the delay in reviewing this.

I think in general there may be some value in this.

I think you'd have a far better experience (and some more real wifi
testing) by adding the ability to route the hwsim virtual air/medium of
the inside of the VM to the outside of the VM, and then you could run
APs there and bridge to ethernet etc. That way, you could have far more
realistic WiFi with multiple APs etc. with not all that much effort.


Regarding the patch itself:

Can you have a more elaborate example that includes how to specify the
ethernet link to use?

You only have a single 5 GHz channel? That's pretty atypical - there are
no real devices that behave this way. I wouldn't be surprised if some
userspace assumes you have at least one 2.4 GHz channel, so I'd argue
you should have a more regular setup here.

err, well, you can't really have 10Mbps as a rate ... it doesn't exist.
Also, short preamble is irrelevant on 5 GHz.

Again, you should have a more regular setup here.

And probably best to support the normal 8 bitrates supported on 5GHz at
least?

Or perhaps put the whole thing on 2.4GHz since chips actually exist that
only have 2.4 (vs. none that only have 5), and support some HT/VHT even
to make it look like it's not out of the last millenium? :)

That signal level is questionable ... better limit to something actually
used in practice like -60 dBm?

Well, use a locally assigned address at least if you're going to fake
something?

SSIDs can very well contain NUL bytes, so this is not a valid way to
print them.

Why would you even want to print the request anyway though, if your
stated goal is to make it look to userspace like a wifi link, vs.
debugging?

Plus you can always run "iw event" to see it.

That's way too fast, so for any realism you should probably wait 2-3
seconds. Well, you only have one channel, so perhaps only 100-200ms? But
10ms is not realistic.

Updating the static variable seems a bit weird, this could be concurrent
for different instances, afaict?

more idiomatic kernel coding style would put the | at the end of the

that's not quite a realistic duration, but I guess nobody cares

Well, I guess at the very least you should check you're connecting to
the right AP? Or maybe not, since you only fake one to exist in the
first place.

Same problem with globals being modified though.

Some delay might be appropriate.

What's netlink_utils.cpp? :-)

More seriously though, if you're proposing a general addition, the
hidden Android reference isn't all that helpful.

Yeah, well, -1 is like taking a jet engine next to your ear ... not
going to happen. Go with something reasonable instead, maybe -60?

That's not realistic.

That seems a little *too* minimal, and too much at the same time...

Practially no drivers, apart from mac80211 ones, implement auth/assoc -
in particular not most chips used in Android. So connect/disconnect
instead of auth/assoc/deauth/disassoc might be more realistic.

On the other hand, if you have get_station you should probably have
dump_station so people can use tools other than Android.

Well, typical implementations limit this to 4, or 20, so this is
certainly excessive.

You obviously only support NL80211_IFTYPE_STATION - the other modes
require many more ops to be implemented.

Nope, has none of these.

None of these either.

This really should only work while connected on "wifi".

I guess this should also only do something while connected.
