A sane guest will not issue PQAP(AQIC) if it doesn't have ap
capabilities, but there's nothing that keeps a guest from issuing that
instruction regardless.

However, is this instruction always intercepted and never handled by
the SIE itself, even if the guest was not configured for ap? By which
criteria do we enable interception?

So, all of these happen prior to checking the function code?

Will we set that facility even if no vfio-ap device is configured?

If e.g. calling that instruction from userspace always creates a priv
op exception, that should be checked prior to even looking at the
function code. Same with other exceptions. From my no-docs point of
view, it makes sense to have those common checks in handle_pqap() and
use the switch/case to call handler functions for the individual
function codes...

I agree.
