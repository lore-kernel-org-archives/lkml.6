Seems you'd have to rerun the configuration, because
include/config/auto.conf is only regenerated if it's older than .config.

Here's the bit in the root Makefile that does it (KCONFIG_CONFIG is
.config).

	# If .config is newer than include/config/auto.conf, someone tinkered
	# with it and forgot to run make oldconfig.
	# if auto.conf.cmd is missing then we are probably in a cleaned tree so
	# we execute the config step to be sure to catch updated Kconfig files
	include/config/%.conf: $(KCONFIG_CONFIG) include/config/auto.conf.cmd
		$(Q)$(MAKE) -f $(srctree)/Makefile silentoldconfig

silentoldconfig is a terrible name. What it actually does is run that
"second phase" stuff.

Pretty sure that comment lies by the way. 'make oldconfig' doesn't
update include/config/auto.conf. It's probably outdated.


I wonder if it would be simpler to just always run silentoldconfig when
building. It's not that slow on my system:

	$ export ARCH=x86 SRCARCH=x86 KERNELVERSION=`make kernelversion`
	$ time scripts/kconfig/conf --silentoldconfig Kconfig

	real	0m0.167s
	user	0m0.162s
	sys	0m0.004s

That'd both simplify the Makefiles, and make sure that the latest
features are always used if you do feature testing in Kconfig.

I don't know how strongly people feel about a few tenths of a second
though.

Cheers,
Ulf
