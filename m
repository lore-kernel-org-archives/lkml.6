I'll add an Adiantum testing mode to tcrypt, though I have to admit that I
really dislike tcrypt, so I've actually been using a custom patch instead
(https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ebiggers/linux.git/commit/?h=cryptobench).

FWIW, I mostly dislike tcrypt's lack of flexibility.  Every benchmark setting
has to be coded explicitly in tcrypt, with a mode number to select it.  It's
often missing what I want, or what I want is included but comes with a bunch of
unwanted tests too.  Also tcrypt has to be built as a loadable module, so it
can't be used with CONFIG_MODULES=n.  And the benchmark results only go directly
to the kernel log, where they aren't easily retrievable from a script.

The patch I've been using just exposes a file /proc/cryptobench (note: it maybe
should be made into a char device instead) to which you can write commands like:

	algtype=skcipher algname=adiantum(xchacha12,aes) keysize=32 bufsize=4096 niter=1000

Then userspace reads back the result:

	SUCCESS algname=adiantum(xchacha12,aes) driver_name=adiantum(xchacha12-software,aes-aesni,nhpoly1305-generic) measurement=0x30a5abd5776e0af enc_time=44831104 dec_time=38303077

It's then pretty straightforward to wrap this API in a userspace script that
does all the benchmarks you need, and formats the results nicely.

For correctness testing there's also an option 'sgl_fuzz' that randomizes the
scatterlist division.

Currently the patch is missing some features such as AEAD support, but at some
point I'd like to get it into a state where it can be included upstream.
