The rationale is that any of these can result in implicit calls to C
functions at arbitrary points during erase_kstack(). That could
interfere with the search for poison, and/or leave data on the stack
which is not erased.

They won't result in hard failures, as KASAN would, but we should
probably avoid them regardless.

Ok. Under what circumstances does that happen?

It seems a little scary that curent::thread::lowest_stack might not be
on current's task stack. Is that reset when transitioning to/from the
trampoile stack?

I'm just not sure I see the point in the offset, given things like
VMAP_STACK exist. BUG_ON() handling will likely require *more* than 256
bytes of stack, so it seems superfluous, as we'd be relying on stack
overflow detection at that point.

I can see that we should take the CONFIG_SCHED_STACK_END_CHECK offset
into account, though.

In the hyp/EL2 exception level, we only map the hyp text, and not the
rest of the kernel. So erase_kstack and check_alloca won't be mapped,
and attempt to branch to them will fault.

Even if it were mapped, things like BUG_ON(), get_current(), etc do not
work at hyp.

Additionally, the hyp code is mapped as a different virtual address from
the rest of the kernel, so if any of the STACKLEAK code happens to use
an absolute address, this will not work correctly.

Thanks,
Mark.
