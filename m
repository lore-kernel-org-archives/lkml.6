Well it is described by the following document:

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sound/audio-graph-card.txt

Previous revision of the codec also worked perfectly fine
with the simple card binding, which does the DAI stuff
differently:

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sound/simple-card.txt

A quick check of the other codecs suggested, that none of them
descibes the graph based binding style. AFAIUI they could be
used with it, though. So if you have a suggestion for a better
binding document I can adopt this in the next version.

I agree, that it's not required. Also the node is not required.
Everything could be dumped into the main node. Many things are
not required, but they make implementations easier and help in
regards to DT readability and consistency. Having the compatible
means, that all sub-functions _can_ be handled equally by the
operating system. Not having the compatible means you _always_
need special handling for the audio codec. This basically makes
the codec node different for the simple purpose of "because it is
not strictly required". If we have a compatible node, other
operating systems can still decide to ignore it, right?
