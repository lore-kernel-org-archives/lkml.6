The kernel exports the characteristics of the information exchange
event, ie. Actor(process)/Subject(inode) identity attributes, the
userspace implementation processes those according to policy
directives and maintains a contour map of the current behavior of the
system.  Most commonly it compares this map to a map that is supplied
with the policy directives to determine if the behavior of the system
is 'on-or-off contour'.

Mimi invited us to present our work at the Linux Security Summit in
Seattle the year before last.

You can get the paper that we wrote to support the presentation at the
following link:

ftp://ftp.idfusion.net/pub/idfusion/iso-identity.pdf

I think it is also still available at kernsec.org.

The paper discussed a specific hardware implementation but has a full
discussion of the theory we use to implement deterministically modeled
application platforms.

Our work has advanced significantly from where things were at when we
wrote that paper.  Most specifically, almost everything has moved to
userspace in order to be hosted in a trusted execution environment.

The paper also does not cover our work on per-process LSM's to
regulate the behavior of processes that have gone 'off-contour',
ie. are bad actors.

We tend to be fond of a clone flag, the most important issue is to
have an independent namespace that addresses the integrity/behavior
status of a process and its subordinates.

Yes, although most of our work now revolves around using a trusted
execution environment.

One of the problems with TPM's are a limited number of resettable
PCR's.  One solution, obviously, is to run virtual TPM's but that has
security footprint implications.  The use of a TEE also provides a
convenient framework for building a 'cloud' based integrity
orchestration system that is, theoretically, independent of the state
of the platform.

If the container runtime is responsible for creating and/or managing
the integrity/behavior namespace, that infrastructure needs to become
mainline and propagate to become useful.  In our case this includes
setting up a TEE on a per container/canister basis.  This is just the
the standard upstream tooling problem.

Our paper goes into the theory of why and how we postulate that
behavior is ultimately a manifestation of integrity, or conversely,
integrity monitoring is simply a subset of behavioral modeling.

This includes the notion of extra-dimensional vs intra-dimensional
security events which is another can of worms.  We are letting the
experts in Haskell and formal verification solve the latter problem
while we focus on the former... :-)

A very granular expression of an identity constructed and assigned to
a process(actor)/inode(subject) interaction.

More classically, the model can be thought of as assigning unique
identities to the positive accession elements of a type enforcement
matrix.

You commented above that you believe that behavior is a function of
what software does.  Ultimately and most fundamentally, software
translates into actor/subject interactions in the OS, so modeling at
this level captures the behavior of the software.

As an industry, we depend on this model for our most basic security
guarantees, since both discretionary and mandatory access controls
implement platform security by arbitrating these events.

This is why an independent behavioral/integrity namespace is so
important to this work.  With respect to a cloud environment, we are
primarily focused on implementing a definition of behavior at the
level of the container, or canister as we refer to it, ie. a
'container with a label'.

In this model, a 'behaviorally trusted cloud' platform or node would
be a very minimal canister/container launch system that would itself
have a precise behavioral definition rooted in something like a
hardware TPM and thus hardware attestable.  This is why we export the
hardware aggregate measurement up into the behavioral modeling engine
for a canister.

This provides a framework where a canister can be pushed up into a
cloud platform which is attesting a known behavior.  The canister can
then attest that it has a known behavior derived from and specific to
its execution platform.  If one thinks about this a bit, there is
possibly an important play with respect to blockchain technology in
this model.

All of this, of course, assumes that we can place a great deal of
trust in the isolation capabilities of namespaces.  That seems to be
largely a given at this point in time, since we are talking about per
namespace IMA... :-)

The paper has extensive background information and discussion on all
of these issues.  Let me know if you do read it and I will send you a
bronze medal, as you would be the third person who has read it, after
my wife who checked it for typos.... :-)

The per process LSM work is very recent work but actually quite
straight forward and powerful, if one can get one's head wrapped
around the notion that behavior is a manifestation of a processes
identity.  The notion of per process trust is going to be important as
we battle with the performance impact of micro-architectural
vulnerabilities, as the dialogue on per-process KPTI suggests.

I've always thought the iso-identity model for platform behavior was
very straight forward but I'm learning that may be a bit naive on my
part.

My career evolved out of quantum chemistry where I did very early work
in the field of multi-scale modeling, ie. ab-initio -> newtonian,
model transitioning.  All of this, regardless of it being chemistry or
computers, is very much about 'y = mx + b' if you can stretch your
imagination a bit.

We use self-consistent fields in quantum mechanics since the
complexity of the multi-body problem means that we don't have direct
solutions for anything beyond helium.  Namespaces are important in
deterministic platform modeling since they reduce model complexity and
thus make the problem tractable.

We actually talked about these modeling similarities in the
'cross-pollination tract' of DARPA's high confidence software systems
conference last year:

https://cps-vo.org/node/34578

The site seems to be a bit dysfunctional right now but an
abstract/slides should be there when it is working.

Right now our only concern is advocating for Linux to develop an
independent namespace/clone-bit for encapsulating integrity and/or
behavior.... :-)
