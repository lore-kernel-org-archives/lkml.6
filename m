Yes, it's really that slow, maybe because the NEON unit on Cortex-A7 isn't very
good.  Our figures are shown in the performance table in section 4.  Note that
the abstract is talking about AES-256-XTS.  AES-128-XTS is ~27% faster.  You can
also reproduce our performance results using our userspace benchmark program
from https://github.com/google/adiantum/tree/master/benchmark.  It uses a copy
of aes-neonbs-core.S from the kernel source tree.

As a quick hack, on Cortex-A7 I timed "NH" without loading the message words.
It became about 10% faster.  My NEON-accelerated NH is already only about 1.3
cpb, so that means in theory not having to reload the message words would save
~0.13 cpb...  But Adiantum as a whole is ~11 cpb, so that suggests the
improvement would be only a bit over 1%.

Maybe it could actually be better (for example, not having to map the pages
again could save a lot), but in practice considering the increased complexity as
well as that probably there wouldn't actually be enough registers to do
everything efficiently, it seemed it would cause far too much trouble to bother
yet (at least for the Linux kernel implementation; a two-pass implementation
could still be useful elsewhere, of course).
