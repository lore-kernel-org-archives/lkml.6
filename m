The IDT switch incorrectly flags an ACS source violation on a read config
request to an end point device on the completion (IDT 89H32H8G3-YC,
errata #36) even though the PCI Express spec states that completions are
never affected by ACS source violation (PCI Spec 3.1, Section 6.12.1.1). 
Here's
the specific copy of the errata text

"Item #36 - Downstream port applies ACS Source Validation to Completions
Section 6.12.1.1 of the PCI Express Base Specification 3.1 states
that completions are never affected
by ACS Source Validation. However, completions received by a
downstream port of the PCIe switch from a device that has not yet
captured a PCIe bus number are incorrectly dropped by ACS source
validation by the switch downstream port.

Workaround: Issue a CfgWr1 to the downstream device before issuing
the first CfgRd1 to the device.
This allows the downstream device to capture its bus number; ACS
source validation no longer stops
completions from being forwarded by the downstream port. It has been
observed that Microsoft Windows implements this workaround already;
however, some versions of Linux and other operating systems may not. "

The suggested workaround by IDT is to issue a configuration write to the
downstream device before issuing the first config read. This allows the
downstream device to capture its bus number, thus avoiding the ACS
violation on the completion. In order to make sure that the device is ready
for config accesses, we do what is currently done in making config reads
till it succeeds and then do the config write as specified by the errata.
However, to avoid hitting the errata issue when doing config reads, we
disable ACS SV around this process.

The patch does the following -

1. Disable ACS source violation if enabled.
2. Wait for config space access to become available by reading vendor id
3. Do a config write to the end point (errata workaround)
4. Enable ACS source validation (if it was enabled to begin with)

-v2: move workaround to pci_bus_read_dev_vendor_id() from 
pci_bus_check_dev()
      and move enable_acs_sv to drivers/pci/pci.c -- by Yinghai
-v3: add bus->self check for root bus and virtual bus for sriov vfs.
-v4: only do workaround for IDT switches
-v5: tweak pci_std_enable_acs_sv to deal with unimplemented SV
-v6: Added errata verbiage verbatim and resolved patch format issues
-v7: changed int to bool for found and idt_workaround declarations. Also
      added bugzilla https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=196979
-v8: Rewrote the patch by adding a new acs quirk to keep the workaround
      out of the main code path
