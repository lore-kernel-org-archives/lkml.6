I'm fine doing that if it makes sense. I just don't understand why you
cannot add ioctls to /dev/kvm for allocating the region. Why isn't that
possible? As I said to Andy earlier, adding new device files is easy as
everything related to device creation is nicely encapsulated.

If the uapi is *only* for KVM, it should definitely own it. KVM calling
SGX subsystem on a conflict is KVM using in-kernel APIs provided by the
SGX core.
