This had just been explained to Jiri: LoRa PHY vs. LoRaWAN MAC. Similar
splits exist for other technologies; and how the LoRaWAN soft-MAC can
reuse underlying LoRa facilities is the very subject of this sub-thread!

It entirely depends on what the user wants to do - connect to a LoRaWAN
network as client, forward LoRaWAN packets as a gateway, communicate
peer-to-peer, implement alternative MACs in userspace, ...

So if a user is working on LoRaWAN MAC layer I expect him to deal with
PF_LORAWAN and nllorawan and not need direct access to nllora, as that
would be an implementation detail specific to the soft-MAC; a hard-MAC
should not need to implement nllora, as it may not have that control.

Okay, I took a shortcut there for LoRa and assume we always have a LoRa
netdev (i.e., no theoretical SDR netdev), so that I could postpone
figuring out how to register extra per-netdev cfg structs for quicker
PoC of the netlink interface. :) My get_freq callback will need to be
moved out from struct lora_dev_priv (lora/netdev.h) into its own struct.

We don't have regmap caching enabled. sx1276 has no paging implemented,
as it's slightly more complicated than sx1301 (and the "youngest" of 3).

I assume instead of just writing from netlink/cfg callbacks to regmap
we'll need to also save the values in the driver for writing them back
after a mode switch or suspend.

However it's also a question of who initiates the mode switch and how,
presumably via netlink.

This is not about iterative development, it's about discussing about a
high-level cfg interface on top of nl on top of a PHY that didn't work;
not just some optional offload feature being broken. ;) We may never
have perfect code, but we can't merge a driver that doesn't work at all,
and as long as I know it's not working sufficiently I am holding back on
sending out a v2, in favor of queuing more fixes and cleanups that'll
make it worth people's time to review.

Having the soft-MAC be further implemented and actually using the
functions it implements may avoid some of the declarations Jiri disliked
by just making them static locally where they're needed.

Earlier reviewers were already getting deep into coding style reviews,
but it seems this is not yet a "PATCH" ready for merging after all and
should therefore by its author be labeled "RFC" or at least "RFT" if it
couldn't be tested yet. If it's a "PATCH", I expect to be able to queue
it on my tree if I spot no major design problems or nits the author
could help fix upfront. Compare below.

No, I don't ignore it, I'm missing infrastructure to evaluate it!

As Jiri has pointed out earlier, this series is doing two things, 1)
introduce LoRaWAN sockets (that's great, needs review/discussion) and 2)
prepare a soft-MAC implementation with a number of functions that are
not yet called from anywhere. Plus the series omits to extend my
lower-level netlink interfaces and driver(s) with the facilities it'll
need to actually work. The default Sync Word on sx1276 is 0x12, for
instance.

Basically Jian-Hong and I are at odds in which direction the layers
should plug together, with me vehemently against coding LoRaWAN stuff in
LoRa drivers (layering violation!) and instead wanting that centrally in
an optional LoRaWAN soft-MAC module (=maclorawan) on top. Compare 2/6
still reading "driver should implement some of them according to the
usage" - for me that should be a cfg struct at the nllorawan layer,
which he should implement in maclorawan and I only for hard-MAC drivers,
instead of exporting an ABI that's not called by anyone and would
seemingly need to be reimplemented in each and every of my LoRa drivers!
Note that duplicate copies and forks of LoRaWAN soft-MAC userspace
implementations on GitHub were one of the reasons for me to start this
kernel project, so I really, really don't want that here. And 5/6 main.c
appears to still be based around the idea that he gets his own loraX
netdevs, seemingly conflicting by name with mine if they would actually
get created by the functions getting called anywhere...

Maybe you can now grasp my annoyance with this non-RFC v5 making only
cosmetic changes since v2? (and completely lacking any changelog in 0/6)

The very definition of a hard-MAC is that it does not need a soft-MAC.

So that doesn't make much sense to me. The netlink interfaces for LoRa
(e.g., Join operations for authentication) will be constrained by what
ops the hard-MACs need, whereas we have much more freedoms with our own
soft-MAC. LoRaWAN provides a meta set of operations compared to LoRa+FSK
(e.g., setting the data rate on MAC layer would involve regional
awareness and translates to setting frequency+bandwidth+SF on PHY layer,
and a LoRa transmission/reception will need to set a Sync Word of 0x34);
therefore my saying that for the soft-MAC we need interfaces and
implementations on my LoRa PHY layer that are still incomplete today.

Once the PHY layer is working, the soft-MAC would just need to properly
dispatch - and ideally I would have it provide packets in an ETH_P_LORA
format, so that I don't need duplicate (ETH_P_LORA + ETH_P_LORAWAN)
implementations in each soft-MAC capable LoRa driver. Thus, if the PHY
doesn't transmit (yet), LoRaWAN can't send either.

And that brings us back to the big question circling since months of how
to design these socket layers: Currently I'm using a PF_LORA and was
hoping to extend its sock_addr to cope with the Sync Word, frequency,
etc. and set that via skb for each TX (which raised problems for RX). At
ELCE 2018 it was suggested that we should rather take the easy route of
not defining a PF_LORA and just use PF_PACKET with htons(ETH_P_LORA) and
apply every global setting via netlink; that however appears to obsolete
my lora/dgram.c code dealing with private ifindex field then, so that we
could no longer pass any LoRa-specific per-packet metadata from LoRaWAN
layer down to LoRa either. And since I'm unfamiliar with PF_PACKET, I'm
focusing on making the basics work first before diving into refactorings
that give us no functional benefits.

Anyway, I assume we'll need to translate from LoRaWAN to LoRa skbs
somewhere in this patch series to add the necessary LoRaWAN headers for
SOCK_DGRAM or SOCK_SEQPACKET packets - it's neither in 1/6 nor in 5/6.
Additionally, operations such as Join that the user would request via
netlink command will need to create LoRa skbs in the soft-MAC directly.
So in that way LoRaWAN may be comparable to Wifi connecting to an AP,
whereas LoRa is more like shoveling packets into/out an Ethernet cable.

Hope that explains better from my side as well.
Most of it had been brought up in replies to the cover letter of my
original RFC on netdev list: https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/cover/937545/
