I don't quite follow.  You're no longer using the "present" and
"link_active" variables in pciehp_handle_presence_or_link_change(),
the variables are set again further down in the function and you're
*also* reading PDS and DLLLA in is_delayed_presence_up_event().
So the above-quoted assignments are superfluous.  Am I missing something?

(Sorry, I had copy-pasted the wrong function name, I meant
is_delayed_presence_up_event() above, not pciehp_check_link_active().

             ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Can we keep this discussion in a neutral tone please?

Thanks,
