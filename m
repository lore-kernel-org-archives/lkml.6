Peter Zijlstra also mentioned that one on IRC, I didn't have it on my radar
before. Like Tile, it has only recently been marked as Orphaned in MAINTAINERS,
so I'd be inclined to wait a little while to give possible users a
chance to step
up as new maintainers.

My plan for v4.17 is now:

- remove score, unicore and metag due to lack of toolchain
  or interest from the maintainers.
- keep hexagon, and try to build an llvm/clang toolchain
- remove frv and m32r due to being abandoned for several years
- mark tile and blackfin for pending removal later this year unless
  a new maintainer steps up
- mark mn10300 for pending removal unless it gets updated to
  support chips that were made in the past 12 years and to build
  properly.
