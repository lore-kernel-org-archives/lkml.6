You can if you want, but I'm betting it basically comes down to
teaching syzcaller about parts of the on-disk format, similar to
AFL. And, like AFL, I doubt any XFS developer has the time to
add such support to syzbot.

Yup, I assumed that this would be the case - those sorts of
"directed fuzzing" techniques were pioneered by the Samba guys for
reverse engineering the SMB protocol used by MS servers all those
years ago. But at it's most basic level, it's still using bit
flipping techniques to perturb the input and provoke responses.

Yup, nothing new there - that's what every other filesystem fuzzer
infrastructure does, too.  The problem with this is that it doesn't
pin-point the actual operation that tripped over the on-disk
corruption. It's catching downstream symptoms of an unknown,
undetected on-disk format corruption. i.e. it's a poor substitute
for explicit testing of structure bounds and data relationships of a
known format.

That's the fundamental premise of fuzz testing - most software does
not have robust validation of it's inputs and so fuzzing those
inputs finds problems. We've moved on from the old "trust and don't
validate" model of filesystem structure architecture.  The on-disk
format is very well defined, it is constrained in most cases, and we
can validate most individual structures at runtime with relatively
little cost.

Hence the "structure bounds" exploits that fuzzers tend to exercise
are pretty much taken out of the picture, and that leaves us with
"data relationships" between structures as the main vector for
undetected corruptions. These are mostly detectable, and many are
correctable as the current on-disk format has a lot of redundant
information. So the space for fuzzers to detect problems is getting
smaller and smaller all the time.

IOWs, filesystem image fuzzers have their place, but if you want us
to take your fuzzing seriously then your fuzzer needs to understand
all the mechanisms we now use to detect corruptions to show us where
they are deficient. If your fuzzing doesn't expose flaws in our
current validation techniques, then it's really not useful to us.

Generally there is no need to do this because we know exactly what
syscalls will trigger access and/or modification to on-disk
structures. Access to the on-disk structures triggers the built in
verifier infrastructure, which then catches the majority of
corruptions before the structure is used by anything in the kernel.

Cheers,

Dave.
