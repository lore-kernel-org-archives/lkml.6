Well, what's the initial state of the list?

That depends on what the initial ordering of the list is and please
note that circular dependencies are explicitly assumed to be not
present.

The assumption is that the initial ordering of the list reflects the
correct suspend (or shutdown) order without the new link.  Therefore
initially all children are located after their parents and all known
consumers are located after their suppliers.

If a new link is added, the new consumer goes to the end of the list
and all of its children and all of its consumers go after it.
device_reorder_to_tail() is recursive, so for each of the devices that
went to the end of the list, all of its children and all of its
consumers go after it and so on.

Now, that operation doesn't change the order of any of the
parent<-child or supplier<-consumer pairs that get moved and since all
of the devices that depend on any device that get moved go to the end
of list after it, the only devices that don't go to the end of list
are guaranteed to not depend on any of them (they may be parents or
suppliers of the devices that go to the end of the list, but not their
children or suppliers).

I don't see this as per the above.

Say, device_reorder_to_tail() moves a parent after its child.  This
means that device_reorder_to_tail() was not called for the child after
it had been called for the parent, but that is not true, because it is
called for all of the children of each device that gets moved *after*
moving that device.

Yes, we can.

My point is that we have not been doing that so far and the current
callers of those routines are expected to know that.

We can do that to make the life of *future* callers easier (and maybe
to simplify the current ones), but currently the caller is expected to
do the right thing.

So the limitation is that circular dependencies may not exist, because
if they did, there would be no suitable suspend/shutdown ordering
between devices.

I simply think that there should be one way to iterate over devices
for both system-wide PM and shutdown.

The reason why it is not like that today is because of the development
history, but if it doesn't work and we want to fix it, let's just
consolidate all of that.

Now, system-wide suspend resume sometimes iterates the list in the
reverse order which would be hard without having a list, wouldn't it?

OK
