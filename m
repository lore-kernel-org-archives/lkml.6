This patch reorganizes the definition of rb in the Linux Kernel Memory
Consistency Model.  The relation is now expressed in terms of
rcu-fence, which consists of a sequence of gp and rscs links separated
by rcu-link links, in which the number of occurrences of gp is >= the
number of occurrences of rscs.

Arguments similar to those published in
http://diy.inria.fr/linux/long.pdf show that rcu-fence behaves like an
inter-CPU strong fence.  Furthermore, the definition of rb in terms of
rcu-fence is highly analogous to the definition of pb in terms of
strong-fence, which can help explain why rcu-path expresses a form of
temporal ordering.

This change should not affect the semantics of the memory model, just
its internal organization.

+The LKMM also defines the gp and rscs relations.  They bring grace
+periods and read-side critical sections into the picture, in the

-	E ->gp-link F means there is a synchronize_rcu() fence event S
-	and an event X such that E ->po S, either S ->po X or S = X,
-	and X ->rcu-link F.  In other words, E and F are linked by a

+	E ->gp F means there is a synchronize_rcu() fence event S such

+	there is a grace period po-between E and F.
 
-	E ->rscs-link F means there is a critical section delimited by
-	an rcu_read_lock() fence L and an rcu_read_unlock() fence U,
-	and an event X such that E ->po U, either L ->po X or L = X,
-	and X ->rcu-link F.  Roughly speaking, this says that some
-	event in the same critical section as E is linked by rcu-link
-	to F.
+	E ->rscs F means there is a critical section delimited by an
+	rcu_read_lock() fence L and an rcu_read_unlock() fence U, such
+	that E ->po U and either L ->po F or L = F.  You can think of
+	this as saying that E and F are in the same critical section
+	(in fact, it also allows E to be po-before the start of the
+	critical section and F to be po-after the end).
 
 If we think of the rcu-link relation as standing for an extended
-"before", then E ->gp-link F says that E executes before a grace
-period which ends before F executes.  (In fact it covers more than
-this, because it also includes cases where E executes before a grace
-period and some store propagates to F's CPU before F executes and
-doesn't propagate to some other CPU until after the grace period
-ends.)  Similarly, E ->rscs-link F says that E is part of (or before
-the start of) a critical section which starts before F executes.
+"before", then X ->gp Y ->rcu-link Z says that X executes before a
+grace period which ends before Z executes.  (In fact it covers more
+than this, because it also includes cases where X executes before a
+grace period and some store propagates to Z's CPU before Z executes
+but doesn't propagate to some other CPU until after the grace period
+ends.)  Similarly, X ->rscs Y ->rcu-link Z says that X is part of (or
+before the start of) a critical section which starts before Z
+executes.
+
+The LKMM goes on to define the rcu-fence relation as a sequence of gp
+and rscs links separated by rcu-link links, in which the number of gp
+links is >= the number of rscs links.  For example:
+
+	X ->gp Y ->rcu-link Z ->rscs T ->rcu-link U ->gp V
+
+would imply that X ->rcu-fence V, because this sequence contains two
+gp links and only one rscs link.  (It also implies that X ->rcu-fence T
+and Z ->rcu-fence V.)  On the other hand:
+
+	X ->rscs Y ->rcu-link Z ->rscs T ->rcu-link U ->gp V
+
+does not imply X ->rcu-fence V, because the sequence contains only
+one gp link but two rscs links.
+
+The rcu-fence relation is important because the Grace Period Guarantee
+means that rcu-fence acts kind of like a strong fence.  In particular,
+if W is a write and we have W ->rcu-fence Z, the Guarantee says that W
+will propagate to every CPU before Z executes.
+
+To prove this in full generality requires some intellectual effort.
+We'll consider just a very simple case:
+
+	W ->gp X ->rcu-link Y ->rscs Z.
+
+This formula means that there is a grace period G and a critical
+section C such that:
+
+	1. W is po-before G;
+
+	2. X is equal to or po-after G;
+
+	3. X comes "before" Y in some sense;
+
+	4. Y is po-before the end of C;
+
+	5. Z is equal to or po-after the start of C.
+
+From 2 - 4 we deduce that the grace period G ends before the critical
+section C.  Then the second part of the Grace Period Guarantee says
+not only that G starts before C does, but also that W (which executes
+on G's CPU before G starts) must propagate to every CPU before C
+starts.  In particular, W propagates to every CPU before Z executes
+(or finishes executing, in the case where Z is equal to the
+rcu_read_lock() fence event which starts C.)  This sort of reasoning
+can be expanded to handle all the situations covered by rcu-fence.
+
+Finally, the LKMM defines the RCU-before (rb) relation in terms of
+rcu-fence.  This is done in essentially the same way as the pb
+relation was defined in terms of strong-fence.  We will omit the
+details; the end result is that E ->rb F implies E must execute before
+F, just as E ->pb F does (and for much the same reasons).
 
 Putting this all together, the LKMM expresses the Grace Period
-Guarantee by requiring that there are no cycles consisting of gp-link
-and rscs-link links in which the number of gp-link instances is >= the
-number of rscs-link instances.  It does this by defining the rb
-relation to link events E and F whenever it is possible to pass from E
-to F by a sequence of gp-link and rscs-link links with at least as
-many of the former as the latter.  The LKMM's "rcu" axiom then says
-that there are no events E with E ->rb E.
-
-Justifying this axiom takes some intellectual effort, but it is in
-fact a valid formalization of the Grace Period Guarantee.  We won't
-attempt to go through the detailed argument, but the following
-analysis gives a taste of what is involved.  Suppose we have a
-violation of the first part of the Guarantee: A critical section
-starts before a grace period, and some store propagates to the
-critical section's CPU before the end of the critical section but
-doesn't propagate to some other CPU until after the end of the grace
-period.
+Guarantee by requiring that the rb relation does not contain a cycle.
+Equivalently, this "rcu" axiom requires that there are no events E and
+F with E ->rcu-link F ->rcu-fence E.  Or to put it a third way, the
+axiom requires that there are no cycles consisting of gp and rscs
+alternating with rcu-link, where the number of gp links is >= the
+number of rscs links.
