One of the things I suggested in a private conversation with Christian 
earlier
today was to provide an additional rw sysfs attribute - a boolean - that 
indicates
whether all usage domains should also be control domains. The default 
could be
true. This would allow one to configure guests with usage-only domains 
as well
as satisfy the convention.
