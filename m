This is still basically a hack to get around a known race. In itself this patch is still worth while in that we shouldn't crash the kernel on a null pointer dereference. However, I think the actual problem still needs to be addressed. We shouldn't run any PRRN events for the source system on the target after a migration. The device tree update should have taken care of telling us about new affinities and what not. Can we just throw out any queued PRRN events when we wake up on the target?
