I appreciate this is somewhat frustrating, but every feature where clang
is not at parity with GCC is effectively a functional regression for us.

Recently, the code that clang hasn't liked happens to be security
critical, and it is somewhat difficult to justify making that code more
complex to cater for a compiler that we know has outstanding issues with
features we rely upon.

Which is to say, I'm not sure that there's much justification either
way. We really need clang to be at feature parity with GCC for it to be
considered supported.

It would be great if some effort could be focussed on bringing clang to
feature parity with GCC before implementing new clang-specific features.

Just to check: does clang implement the rest of the AArch64 machine
constraints [1]?

We're liable to use more of them in future, and we should aim for parity
now so that we don't fall into the same trap in future.

I think what Marc wants is a statement as to whether -fno-jump-tables is
sufficient to ensure that clang will not try to use absolute addressing,
based on an understanding of the AArch64 LLVM backend rather than test
cases.

For example, could any other pass result in the use of an absolute
address? Or are jump tables the *only* reason that clang would try to
use an absolute address.

Are there other options that we might need to pass?

Are there any options that we can pass to forbid absolute addressing?

Thanks,
Mark.
