We don't need them for normal CPU mmaps because that's locally
addressable page fault capable hardware. i.e. if we need to
serialise something, we just use kernel locks, etc. When it's a
remote entity (such as RDMA) we have to get that remote entity to
release it's reference/access so the kernel has exclusive access
to the resource it needs to act on.

IOWs, file layout leases are required for remote access to local
filesystem controlled storage. That's the access arbitration model
the pNFS implementation hooked into XFS uses and it seems to work
just fine. Local access just hooks in to the kernel XFS paths and
triggers lease/delegation recalls through the NFS server when
required.

If your argument is that "existing RDMA apps don't have a recall
mechanism" then that's what they are going to need to implement to
work with DAX+RDMA. Reliable remote access arbitration is required
for DAX+RDMA, regardless of what filesysetm the data is hosted on.
Anything less is a potential security hole.

I had a conference call last week with a room full of people who
want reflink functionality on DAX ASAP. They have customers that are
asking them to provide it, and the only vehicle they have to
delivery that functionality in any reasonable timeframe is XFS.

I have no idea if they want RDMA. It is also irrelevant to the
requirement of and timeframe to support reflink on XFS w/ DAX.

Especially because:

# mkfs.xfs -f -m reflink=0 /dev/pmem1

And now you have an XFS fileysetm configuration that does not
support dynamic moving of physical storage on write. You have to do
this anyway to use DAX right now, so it's hardly an issue to
require this for non-ODP capable RDMA hardware.

---

I think people are missing the point of LSFMM here - it is to work
out what we need to do to support all the functionality that both
users want and that the hardware provides in the medium term.

Once we have reflink on DAX, somebody is going to ask for
no-compromise RDMA support on these filesystems (e.g. NFSv4 file
server on pmem/FS-DAX that allows server side clones and clients use
RDMA access) and we're going to have to work out how to support it.
Rather than shouting at the messenger (XFS) that reports the hard
problems we have to solve, how about we work out exactly what we
need to do to support this functionality because it is coming and
people want it.

Requiring ODP capable hardware and applications that control RDMA
access to use file leases and be able to cancel/recall client side
delegations (like NFS is already able to do!) seems like a pretty
solid way forward here. We've already solved this "remote direct
physical accesses to local fileystem storage arbitration" problem
with NFSv4, we have both a server and a client in the kernel, so
maybe that should be the first application we aim to support with
DAX+RDMA?

Cheers,

Dave.
