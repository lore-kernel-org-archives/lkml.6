I did some thinking, and I don't like using the same message for both
point-to-point links and full-tree links. From a userspace point of view
having an arbitrary terminator in the tree parsing is confusing. So
we're better of not modifying the behavior here.

On the other hand, just printing the link status on probe might be good
enough. If we're downtraining, but there's a slower link somewhere else,
it won't matter much that we're downtrained. Just calling the unmodified
pcie_print_link_status() will most of the time find the exact segment
that's also downtrained. So let's do this in v2
