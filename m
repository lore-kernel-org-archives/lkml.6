Hum, right. Yesterday I was looking into KSM for a different reason and
I've noticed it also does writeprotect pages and deals with races with GUP.
And what KSM relies on is:

write_protect_page()
  ...
  entry = ptep_clear_flush(vma, pvmw.address, pvmw.pte);
  /*
   * Check that no O_DIRECT or similar I/O is in progress on the
   * page
   */
  if (page_mapcount(page) + 1 + swapped != page_count(page)) {
    page used -> bail
  }

And this really works because gup_pte_range() does:

  page = pte_page(pte);
  head = compound_head(page);

  if (!page_cache_get_speculative(head))
    goto pte_unmap;

  if (unlikely(pte_val(pte) != pte_val(*ptep))) {
    bail
  }

So either write_protect_page() page sees the elevated reference or
gup_pte_range() bails because it will see the pte changed.

In the truncate path things are a bit different but in principle the same
should work - once truncate blocks page faults and unmaps pages from page
tables, we can be sure GUP will not grab the page anymore or we'll see
elevated page count. So IMO there's no need for any additional locking
against the GUP path (but a comment explaining this is highly desirable I
guess).
