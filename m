Add UHS/HS200 mode support in sdhci-omap. The programming sequence
for voltage switching, tuning is followed from AM572x TRM
http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/spruhz6j/spruhz6j.pdf
(Similar to all AM57x/DRA7x SoCs). The patch series also implements
workaround for errata published in
http://www.ti.com/lit/er/sprz429l/sprz429l.pdf

patches are created on top of
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ulfh/mmc.git next

The patches along with dt has also been pushed to
https://github.com/kishon/linux-wip.git sdhci_uhs_v5

Changes from v4:
*) Added comment in sdhci for disabling HS200/HS400 mode
*) Fixed a couple of chunks in "Program a relatively accurate SW timeout
   value" which were missed in the previous revision
*) Added a patch in sdhci-omap to get IODelay values of 3.3v DDR mode.
*) Added pinctrl binding documentation for sdhci-omap which was missed
   before.

Changes from v3:
*) Fixed Adrian's comment on error handling when __sdhci_add_host()
   fails
*) Used Adrian's patches for programming SW timeout value.

Changes from v2:
*) Patches in v2 already applied to mmc -next are dropped from the
   series.
*) Changed SW timeout logic as per Adrians's suggestion
*) Validated SDIO with the current patches (added a couple of fixes
   found while adding SDIO support).
*) Used soc_device_match() instead of pdata-quirks as per Tony's
   suggestions.

Changes from v1:
*) Only poll on DAT0 and DATI for card_busy status
*) Cleanup iodelay patch as suggested by Tony.
*) Added quirk to disable HW timeout
*) Use the existing data timer but program a relatively accurate
   SW timeout value (Impacts all platforms)
*) Fix a bug in sdhci which was using data_timer for non data line
   commands
