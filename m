I think there is confusion here, Alex properly explained the scheme
PCIE-device do a ATS request to the IOMMU which returns a valid
translation for a virtual address. Device can then use that address
directly without going through IOMMU for translation.

ATS is implemented by the IOMMU not by the device (well device implement
the client side of it). Also ATS is meaningless without something like
PASID as far as i know.
