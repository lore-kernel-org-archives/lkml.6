If you do munmap(A, size) then all address in the range [A, A+size]
are invalid. This is what i am refering too here. Same for mremap.

No restriction at all here. I think i just wasn't understood.

Yes and that works however any memory access above TASK_SIZE will
return -EFAULT as this is kernel address space so you can only access
anything that is a valid process virtual address.

No you do not.

Sorry if i confused you even more than the first time. Everything works
you have nothing to worry about :)

You do not get anything from HMM mirror, i might add a flag so that
HMM can report this special condition if driver wants to know. If
you want to know you have to look at the vma by yourself. GPU driver
will definitly want to know whem importing so i might add a flag so
that they do not have to lookup the vma themself to know.

Again if you do not care then just ignore everything here, it is
handled by HMM and you do not have to worry one bit. If it worked
with GUP it will work with HMM and with those p2p patches if it
will even works against vma that are mmap of a file and that set
the p2p_map function.
