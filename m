Would the exception handler be a per-thread resource?

If it is: Would the setup and teardown overhead be prohibitive for many
use cases (at least those do not expect a fault)?

Something peripherally related to this interface: Wrappers for signal
handlers (and not just CPU exceptions).  Ideally, we want to maintain a
flag that indicates whether we are in a signal handler, and save and
restore errno around the installed handler.

GCC already supports that on most Linux targets.  You can unwind from
synchronously invoked signal handlers if you compile with
-fnon-call-exceptions.

However, it's tough to set up a temporary signal handler to trigger such
unwinding because those aren't per-thread.

The original SEH was also a rich target for exploiting vulnerabilities.
That's something we really should avoid as well.

I wonder if it would be possible to tack this function onto rseq.

Thanks,
