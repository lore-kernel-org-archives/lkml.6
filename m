I don't quite see the point of this.  You're not suggesting that we
have one Linux Kernel Memory Consistency Model for s390 and another
one for all the other architectures, are you?

If the idea is merely to provide a herd model for s390 then it should 
go into the DIY repository, not into the LKMM repository.
