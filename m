Yes, it's simply wasn't implemented in compilers. Stack [un]poisoning code is always inlined.

But globals is the opposite of that, they all poisoned out-of-line via __asan_register_globals() call.

I'd say it depends on performance boost that inline might give for those complex inline schemes.
The whole inline instrumentation thing exists only because it gives better performance.
