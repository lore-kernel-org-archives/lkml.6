But it is not injecting any faults. It is using the fault-injection 
framework because Michal said that it should use it. The original version 
of the patch didn't use the fault-injection framework at all.

The kvmalloc function can take two branches, the kmalloc branch and 
vmalloc branch. The vmalloc branch is taken rarely, so the kernel contains 
bugs regarding this path - and the patch increases the probability that 
the vmalloc patch is taken, to discover the bugs early and make them 
reproducible.

The patch helps people debug such memory coprruptions (such as using DMA 
API on the result of kvmalloc).
