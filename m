The third option.

OK.

I think fctl is fine (if you don't understand what 'fctl' is, you're
unlikely to understand it even if it were named differently.)

I'd also exclude -EOPNOTSUPP (as this also might happen with e.g. a halt/clear enabled user space, which probes availability of halt/clear support by giving it a try once (yes, I really want to post my patches this week.))
