Hey Eric,

I somehow noted this for the WireGuard side of things but assumed I
didn't need to do so for Zinc. Hah, such wishful thinking. I'll have
this wrapped at 80 for v3.

It was my hope that this entire series could enter the tree through
Dave's net-next, and that I wouldn't have to touch anything in crypto/ or
touch any of Herbert's stuff at all in anyway. However, if you want, I
can start to play with that in another branch for a separate patchset,
and of course I'd really value your feedback on that and on doing it
right.

I can expand on that, sure. One primary advantage that I do touch on on
the big introductory commit message, though, is that sharing code means
that we benefit from the eyeballs and fuzzing hours spent on OpenSSL,
and I think this general advantage is extremely compelling.

Good idea. I'll do that for v3.

I'd like to keep it. It also enables a natural path for a corresponding
userspace library that shares all of the same code, and one that I think
will be compelling to attract academics and developers to contributing
to these efforts. Plus, can't I name what I made?

The SPDX headers for those came out of a discussion on how to encode
CRYPTOGAMS into SPDX from the SPDX mailing list several months ago.

That's a good idea.

But on the other hand, the .S files have been modified and changed to
fit kernel constraints and conventions. They're very much no longer
merely "generated". This is most apparent with the x86_64 files, but is
present too with the ARM files. We're still, I believe, bug-for-bug
similar to the originals -- keeping with the point of going with Andy's
implementations in the first place -- and we've been able to pretty
trivially track OpenSSL changes -- but nonetheless important tweaks have
been done to make this suitable to kernel space.

Thanks. I'll do another pass at these for v3.
