Yes, we currently do not consider much it. After clarification with you, we want to modify the EL3 firmware to follow this rule.

sorry, it is a typo issue.
it should be HCR_EL2.AMO and HCR_EL2.TGE are both clear, but SPSR_EL3.A is set.

Agree.

"BERT trick" is storing the RAS error in the BERT and 'reboot, right?

Agree.

"can not be delivered" means storing the RAS error in the BERT and 'reboot, right?
In the Table D1-15 in "D1.14.2 Asynchronous exception masking", for the case, it is "C"
"C"means SError is not taken regardless of the value of the Process state interrupt mask.
for this case, whether it will be unsafe if  BIOS directly reboot?

For this case, whether it will be unsafe if  BIOS directly reboot?
For example, for some test purpose, EL0 set PSTATE.A, just right happen SError, then BIOS will reboot system.
I am afraid that system will become unsafe because BIOS will reboot system.

In summary:

[1]:
Route-to-EL1 + interrupted-EL1, if SPSR_EL3.A is set, EL3 firmware can't deliver the emulated-SError, store the RAS error in the BERT and 'reboot.
Route-to-EL2 + interrupted-EL2, if SPSR_EL3.A is set, EL3 firmware can't deliver the emulated-SError, store the RAS error in the BERT and 'reboot.

I agree above two cases, but maybe we need to ensure that only in EL2 SError handler and EL1 SError exception handler the PSTATE.A is set, for other places, the PSTATE.A is not set.
then BIOS can know this is nested-SError when find the SPSR_EL3.A is set, can we ensure that in the Linux kernel code and KVM code?

[2]:
Route-to-EL2 + interrupted-EL1, regardless of SPSR_EL3.A the emulated SError can be delivered to EL2.
Route-to-EL2 + interrupted-EL0, regardless of SPSR_EL3.A the emulated SError can be delivered to EL2.

I agree above two cases.

[3]:
Route-to-EL1+interrupted-EL0, if SPSR_EL3.A is set, EL3 firmware can't deliver the emulated-SError, store the RAS error in the BERT and 'reboot
Route-to-EL1+interrupted-EL2, EL3 firmware store the RAS error in the BERT and 'reboot regardless of SPSR_EL3.A.

For above two cases, I am worried system will become unsafe because BIOS will reboot system.
