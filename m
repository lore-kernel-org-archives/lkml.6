To give people a bit more background here, this is something that both
Andi Kleen and I talked about over a decade ago.  Martijn based his work
on Andi's original patches and made them all work well, something that I
was unable to do :)

His addition of using the build system to automatically generate a patch
for a subsystem based on the symbol namespace changes is frickin
amazing.

Great work here, this is something that I have wanted for the kernel for
a long time.
