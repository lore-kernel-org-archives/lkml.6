Copy_from_user should be safe to copy an arbitrary amount, the only restriction
is that optlen can't exceed the size of the buffer receiving the data in the
kernel.  From that standpoint your patch is safe.  However,  that exposes the
problem of checking any tail data on the userspace buffer.  That is to say, if
you want to ensure that any extra data that gets sent from userspace isn't
'set', you would have to copy that extra data in consumable chunks and check
them individaully, and that screams DOS to me (i.e. imagine a user passing in a
4GB buffer, and having to wait for the kernel to copy each X sized chunk,
looking for non-zero values).
