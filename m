I agree. That can be worked on independently.

mcbsp3_port: port {
	cpu_dai3: endpoint {
		dai-format =3D "dsp_a";
		frame-master =3D <&cpcap_audio_codec1>;
		bitclock-master =3D <&cpcap_audio_codec1>;
		remote-endpoint =3D <&cpcap_audio_codec1>;
	};
};

I think we could configure "normal" mode to use the same settings
as call mode. But ASoC will disable CPCAP, since there will be no
active user without ASoC knowing about the modem.

That's correct, the .config needs to change. I think that's
ok, because the only alternative is having no audio support
at all until the soundcard driver is ready. This means, that
you also need to change .config once its ready (in case you
want to use it).
