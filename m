To enumerate a driver to get processor temperature and get power
properties, we have two methods:
-  The older Atom processors valleyview and Baytrail had no PCI device
for the processor thermal management. There was INT3401 ACPI device to
handle this.

- The newer processors for core and Atom, has a dedicate PCI device and
there is no INT3401 ACPI device anymore.
Since OEM systems will have different power properties and thermal
trips, there is a companion ACPI device, which provides PPCC and
thermal trips and optionally output from another temperature sensor
from the default on processor cores.

Thanks,
Srinivas
