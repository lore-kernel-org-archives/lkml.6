NO!

See 'man errno':
    EACCES     Permission denied
    EPERM      Operation not permitted

Someone was drinking when they chose those abbreviations or had a perverse
sense of humour. It might also explain why some folks say "access denied"
rather than "permission denied".

So if the process/user doesn't have root permissions and they are required,
that should generate an EACCES errno (and no action taken).
