This is simple not true. The reason is this is a design decision. The older
cards are simple somewhat more complicated and we don't want to
add even more complexity to the ap virtualization implementation.
We also said several times that APXA is a requirement not a feature.

Btw: this is an excellent example about thinking beyond the current design.
We don't want to dedicate Accelerators to guests. Accelerators should be
shared, CCA and EP11 Coprocessors should be dedicated. So maybe
change the example to use EP11 and CCA Coprocessors .... and think
about how shared Accelerators could be handled.
