Hi Michael,

Please run "git log --oneline drivers/pci/setup-bus.c" and follow
the usual style.

Use conventional SHA1 reference (12-char SHA1).

Agreed, this sounds like a problem.

Maybe so.  The ideal thing might be to have a trivial patch like this
that can be marked for stable, immediately followed by the nicer
patch.  Trivial band-aids tend to accumulate and make things harder in
the future.

I'd have to take a much harder look at the problem to understand
1f82de10d6b1.  The comment about "double check" seems misleading -- as
you say, the hardware doesn't change and checking once should be
enough.  And if we're calling pci_bridge_check_ranges() more than
necessary, that sounds like a problem, too.

Are there URLs to these reports that we could include in the changelog?

Use conventional multi-line comment style.

This test isn't 100%: devices below the bridge could be using only IO,
or theoretically could be even using just config space.

If it's safe to bail out if the bridge is in use, why isn't it safe to
bail out *always*?
