Not a py2 or py3 thing. I *guess* it is caused by changes in the underlying
docutils.

Yes, this is a very confusing and we have to look at reST, docutils, Sphinx-doc,
virtualenv py2 & py3, all these distros and the philosophy of the Linux
community to understand.

Yes, this is a very confusing and we have to look at reST, docutils, Sphinx-doc,
virtualenv py2 & py3, all these distros and the philosophy of the Linux
community to understand.

reST: Is the markup.

docutils (python): Is the reST reference implementation with some changes in
  2017[1].

Sphinx-doc (python): reST application based on the docutils lib
  (docutils>=0.11)[2].  Take in mind, this dependency opens a new array of
  confusion, cause its fulfillment is based on what is installed on your system
  (or in your virtualenv, see below). Side node: the pdf-builder (LaTeX, to be
  correct) is in a continues redesign since the last two years and was horrible
  in older Sphinx-doc versions. E.g. take a look at the current 1.8.0
  development (section deprecated)[4].

python: py2 will retire in 2020 (py3 was released in 2008). All py applications
   we using are py2 and py3 compatible. If we have no bugs, py2 or py3 should
   never be the cause.

distros: Nearly all distros using using py2 as there default python interpreter
   (mostly since there package managers are written/tested with py2).

virtualenv: A virtualenv is build up in the $HOME folder where Sphinx-doc and
   docutils are installed from pypi, the python package manager[3]. Take in
   mind, using another package in parallel to the system package manager manager
   opens another array of confusion.

Normally I would say, lets use (and test against) state of the art. This is
easily done by installing py3 and using virtualenv. But this seems not match the
philosophy of the whole Linux community.

As one told me, the philosophy is to build the Kernel with less installations
from the web by using what the distro ships. IMO this might be right for the
Kernel but not for applications building viewing formats. When it comes to
build PDF you will realize how naive this approach is. IMO there is also no
need to build viewing formats as we can read the documentation in plain text
as we can do it since the beginning ... and this is one reason why we changed
from XML to a plain text markup.

The script named 'sphinx-pre-install' is the crutch that supports this
philosophy.

We have this discussion over and over again an I believe we will have it again
and again, as long as we do not change our POV .. building viewing formats is
an application not a part of the Kernel.
 
Anyway, I hope this helps to clarify, why we have those problems.
