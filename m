I'm a little confused about the relation between reset and retrain.
AIUI we can retrain the link without any sort of endpoint reset and if
some sort of driver/firmware setup is required on the endpoint to
achieve the target link speed, then I'd think we only want to retrain.
How this is going to work with vfio is an interesting question.  We're
only providing access to the device, not the link to the device.
Multifunction endpoints become a big problem if one function starts
requesting link retraining while another is in use elsewhere.

Yes, I think the core should provide a retraining API, that would also
make the Pericom quirk easier to implement.  We'd want a field/flag on
the pcidev that could be set by quirks to limit the highest target
rate, but it makes sense that this should be an interface provided by
and control point for the PCI core.  Thanks,
