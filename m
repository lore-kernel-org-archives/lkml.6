Hypervisors don't currently expose any topology based on the grouping,
the only case where such a concept even makes sense is when a vIOMMU is
present as devices within the same group cannot have separate address
spaces.  Our options for exposing such information is also limited, our
only real option would seem to be placing devices within the same group
together on a conventional PCI bus to denote the address space
granularity.  Currently we strongly recommend singleton groups for this
case and leave any additional configuration constraints to the admin.

The case you note of a group passed to VM A and another passed to VM B
is exactly an example of why any sort of dynamic routing change needs to
have the groups fully released, such as via hot-unplug.  For instance,
a routing change at a shared node above groups 1 & 2 could result in
the merging of these groups and there is absolutely no way to handle
that with portions of the group being owned by two separate VMs after
the merge.  Thanks,

Alex
