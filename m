Thanks for confirming this!

The root cause of the regression is likely the change in
pci_enable_wake() removing the device_may_wakeup() check from it.

Probably, one of the drivers in the platform calls pci_enable_wake()
directly from its ->shutdown() callback and that causes the device to
be set up for system wakeup which in turn causes the power draw while
the system is off to increase.

I would look at the PCI drivers used on that platform to find which of
them call pci_enable_wake() directly from ->shutdown() and I would
make these calls conditional on device_may_wakeup().
