Hi Juri,
following are some notes I took while trying to understand what's going on...
could be useful to understand if I have a correct view of all the different
components and how they come together.

At the end there are also a couple of possible updates and a question on your
proposal.

Cheers Patrick

Right, so the problem seems to be that we "need" to call
arch_update_cpu_topology() and we do that by calling
partition_sched_domains() which was initially introduced by:

   029190c515f1 ("cpuset sched_load_balance flag")

back in 2007, where it's also quite well explained the reasons behind
the sched_load_balance flag and the idea to have "partitioned" SDs.

I also (hopefully) understood that there are at least two actors involved:

 - A) arch code
   which creates SDs and SGs, usually to group CPUs depending on the
   memory hierarchy, to support different time granularity of load
   balancing operations

   Special case here are HP and hibernation which, by on-/off-lining
   CPUs they directly affect the SDs/SGs definitions.

 - B) cpusets
   which expose to userspace the possibility to define,
   _if possible_, a finer granularity set of SGs to further restrict the
   scope of load balancing operations

Since B is a "possible finer granularity" refinement of A, then we
trigger A's reconfigurations based on B's constraints.

That's why, for example, in consequence of an HP online event,
we have:

   --- core.c -------------------
    HP[sched:active]
     | sched_cpu_activate()
       | cpuset_cpu_active()
   --- cpuset.c -----------------
         | cpuset_update_active_cpus()
           | schedule_work(&cpuset_hotplug_work)
            \.. System Kworker \
                | cpuset_hotplug_workfn()
                  if (cpus_updated || force_rebuild)
                    | rebuild_sched_domains()
                      | rebuild_sched_domains_locked()
                        | generate_sched_domains()
   --- topology.c ---------------
                        | partition_sched_domains()
                          | arch_update_cpu_topology()


IOW, we need to pass via cpusets to rebuild the SDs whenever we
there are HP events or we "need" to do an arch_update_cpu_topology()
via the arch topology driver (drivers/base/arch_topology.c).

This last bit is also interesting, whenever we detect arch topology
information that required an SD rebuild, we need to force a
partition_sched_domains(). But, for that, in:

   commit 50e76632339d ("sched/cpuset/pm: Fix cpuset vs. suspend-resume bugs")

we just introduced the support for the "force_rebuild" flag to be set.

Thus, potentially we can just extend the check I've proposed to consider the
force rebuild flag, to be something like:

---8<---

+       /* Special case for the 99% of systems with one, full, sched domain */

+       force_rebuild = false;
+
        /* Generate domain masks and attrs */
        ndoms = generate_sched_domains(&doms, &attr);
 
        /* Have scheduler rebuild the domains */
        partition_sched_domains(ndoms, doms, attr);
 out:
        put_online_cpus();
---8<---


Which would still allow to use something like:

   cpuset_force_rebuild()
   rebuild_sched_domains()

to actually rebuild SD in consequence of arch topology changes.

Yes, that's another option... although there we are outside of
get_online_cpus(). Could be a problem?

However, in general, I would say that all around:

   rebuild_sched_domains
   rebuild_sched_domains_locked
   update_cpumask
   update_cpumasks_hier

a nice refactoring would be really deserved :)
