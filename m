The existing proposal by Shameer exposes an IOVA list, which includes
ranges that the user _can_ map through the IOMMU, therefore this
original patch is unnecessary, the IOMMU geometry is already the
starting point of the IOVA list, creating the original node, which is
split as necessary to account for the reserved regions.  To me,
presenting a user interface that exposes ranges that _cannot_ be mapped
is a strange interface.  If we started from a position of what
information do we want to provide to the user and how will they consume
it, would we present a list of reserved ranges?  I think the only
argument for the negative ranges is that we already have them in the
kernel, but I don't see that it necessarily makes them the right
solution for userspace.

I think it's unnecessary given that in Shameer's proposal:

 - We start from the IOMMU exposed geometry
 - We present a list of usable IOVA ranges, not a list of reserved
   ranges

Thanks,
Alex
