All,

I think this has converged to a mergeable state now (taking the
mini-tweak for patch #3 into account I provided in a reply)

Are there any objections to this being merged?

Andrew,

If nobody objects, is this something you would care to pick up for the
next cycle? Do I need to respin to incorporate the mini-tweak and
apply Nico's ack to patch #2?

Thanks,
Ard.
