It is a bunch of glue code which enumerates the PCI devices a CPU
has and other in-kernel users can use that instead of doing the
discovery/enumeration themselves.

If you mean physical hotadd, then that's a non-issue as, AFAIK, AMD
doesn't support that.

Now, TBH I've never tried soft-offlining the cores of a node and then
check whether using the PCI devices of that node would work.

Now, I don't mind this getting converted to a proper PCI driver as long
as it is not a module as it has to be present at all times. Other than
that, I'm a happy camper.

Thx.
