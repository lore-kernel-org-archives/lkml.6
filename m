The GIC is fine, I believe. What is not exactly fine is the signalling
from the device, which will never be dropped until the EOI has been
detected.

Given that VFIO is built around this mechanism, I don't think we have a
choice but to support it. Anyway, I came up with the following patch,
which I tested on Seattle with mtty. It also survived my usual
hammering of cyclictest, hackbench  and bulk VM installs.

Shunyong, could you please give it a go?

Thanks,

	M.

Subject: [PATCH] KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Disallow Active+Pending for level
 interrupts

It was recently reported that VFIO mediated devices, and anything
that VFIO exposes as level interrupts, do no strictly follow the
expected logic of such interrupts as it only lowers the input
line when the guest has EOId the interrupt at the GIC level, rather
than when it Acked the interrupt at the device level.

The GIC's Active+Pending state is fundamentally incompatible with
this behaviour, as it prevents KVM from observing the EOI, and in
turn results in VFIO never dropping the line. This results in an
interrupt storm in the guest, which it really never expected.

As we cannot really change VFIO to follow the strict rules of level
signalling, let's forbid the A+P state altogether, as it is in the
end only an optimization. It ensures that we will transition via
an invalid state, which we can use to notify VFIO of the EOI.
