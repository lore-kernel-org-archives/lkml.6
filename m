You also said "Currently we does not consider much about the mask status(SPSR)."

Yes.

If neither of these bits is set: (AMO==0 && TGE == 0)

(I'm reading this as all three of these bits are clear)

No, (AMO==0 && TGE == 0) means SError is routed to EL1, this exception
interrupted EL1 and the A bit was clear, so EL1 can take an SError.

The two cases here are:
AMO==0,TGE==0 means SError should be routed to EL1. If SPSR_EL3 says the
exception interrupted EL1 and the A bit was set, you need to do the BERT trick.

If SPSR_EL3 says the exception interrupted EL2, you need to do the BERT trick
regardless of the A bit, as SError is implicitly masked by running at a higher
exception level than it was routed to.

(this is re-iterating the two-cases above:)
'not be routed to' is one of two things: Route-to-EL2+interruted-EL1, or
Route-to-EL1+interrupted-EL2.

Route-to-EL2+interrupted-EL1 is fine, regardless of SPSR_EL3.A the emulated
SError can be delivered to EL2, as EL2 can't mask SError when executing at a
lower EL.

Route-to-EL1+interrupted-EL2 is the problem. SError is implicitly masked by
running at a higher EL. Regardless of SPSR_EL3.A, the emulated SError can not be
delivered.
KVM does this on the way out of a guest, if an SError occurs during this time
the CPU will wait until execution returns to EL1 before delivering the SError.
Your firmware has to do the same.

Table D1-15 in "D1.14.2 Asynchronous exception masking" has a table with all the
combinations. The ARM-ARM is what we need to match with this behaviour.

I thought interrupted-EL0 could always be delivered: but re-reading the
ARM-ARM's "D1.14.2 Asynchronous exception masking", if asynchronous exceptions
are routed to EL1 then EL0&EL1 are treated the same.
So if SError is routed to EL1, the exception interrupted EL0, and SPSR_EL3.A was
set, you still can't deliver the emulated-SError you have to do the BERT-trick.
Linux doesn't do this today, but another OS might (e.g. UEFI), and we might do
this in the future.

This is really tricky for firmware to get right. Another alternative would be to
put the CPER records in a Polled buffer, unless something needs doing right now,
in which case a BERT-reboot is probably best.


Thanks,

James
