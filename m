It's true that I try to avoid adding *any* kernel parameters as much
as possible because they're usually not practical for end-users.

I think it's unreasonable to expect users to use "pci=" parameters
based on what specific hardware they have.  That's too hard to
discover and too hard to use.  I did wonder about a "pci=safe"
parameter that would disable potentially risky features just as a
debugging feature [1].

This ATS case is a security question and the parameter is not
something that would have to be used to get certain hardware to work,
so I think it's probably reasonable to add.  I would maybe expand the
documentation so it includes the reason somebody might want it, i.e.,
to defend against malicious PCIe devices.

A parameter using bitmasks could be conceivable for developers but
sounds too unwieldy for end-users.
