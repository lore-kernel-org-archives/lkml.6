We haven't said "we don't want syzbot to run on XFS" - we've been
saying "we want syzbot to run on the new XFS format". i.e. you've
got completely the wrong end of the stick.

We got the first ever usable user bug report for this in late
February on a v5 filesystem. Just because a bug has been there for
a long time, it doesn't mean that users or test programs are
tripping over it.  e.g.  trinity has been fuzzing filesystems (as
have many other tools), but they never hit this because of the
unlikely combination of events needed to trigger the failure.

The first proposed fix was mid-march:

https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-xfs/msg16601.html

IOWs, trying to associate this bug with the on-disk format issues we
want fixed, or even attributing the finding and fixing this bug to
syzbot is stretching the truth somewhat. Yes, syzbot tripped over it
fairly quickly and that is great, but let's no try to rewrite
history....

However, I think this silly desire to get everything syzbot reports
attributed to syzbot regardless of reality has clouded the important
observation that should have been made here.  Everyone seems to have
missed the fact that syzbot uncovered a general class of filesystem
implementation error.  i.e.  Several filesystem implementations have
failed to handle ->fill_super errors correctly and syzbot tripped
over many of them - XFS is just one example.

The common mistake being made is failing to clear sb->s_fs_info when
it was freed on ->fill_super failure, and hence had subsequent
problems when ->kill_super was called and the code assumed
->s_fs_info was still valid. There have been other problems due to
sb->s_fs_info needing to be being assigned before the filesystem is
fully set up, and some of them were fixed by the SB_BORN change the
above patch morphed into after initial review.

IOWs, there is a general class of implementation bug here, and maybe
there's something we can learn from that - is our documentation
lacking, the API too convoluted, etc? Understanding why this
happened and making sure we don't do it again is far more important
than fixing any individual bug. And what other general
programming/API error patterns has syzbot tripped over that nobody
has noticed because there's no-one actually paying attention to the
general scope of bugs that syzbot is discovering?

OTOH, knowing how many bugs lurk in our code base, I'm still amazed
that tools like syzbot find so few of them.

Cheers,

Dave.
