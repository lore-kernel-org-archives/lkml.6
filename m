Why should the guest know anything about this? Getting the device to a
usable state respectively cleaning up is the responsibility of the host
code. This processing will happen before the guest gets use of the
device or after it has lost use of it already (or it is some internal
handling like reset, which the guest should not be made aware of).

See my reply above.

>From the kerneldoc comment for cio_cancel_halt_clear():

 * This should be called repeatedly since halt/clear are asynchronous           
 * operations. We do one try with cio_cancel, three tries with cio_halt,        
 * 255 tries with cio_clear. The caller should initialize @iretry with          
 * the value 255 for its first call to this, and keep using the same            
 * @iretry in the subsequent calls until it gets a non -EBUSY return.

Hm, I think the changes to the fsm semantics are a bit mixed up between
patches. I'll wait for an outline of how this is supposed to look in
the end before commenting further :)

As described above, we need to be clear on what should be guest-visible
and what is just internal handling e.g. during initialization/removal.

The comment basically refers to "we aren't quite sure whether there is
more stuff we need to reset", so I think this is indeed the correct
place.
