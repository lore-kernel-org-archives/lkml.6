You're right - but you have chosen the uneasy path. Fixing __vmalloc code 
is easy and it doesn't require cooperation with maintainers.

Developers should fix bugs in advance, not to wait until a crash hapens, 
is analyzed and reported.

What's the problem with 15-line hack? Is the problem that kernel 
developers would feel depressed when looking the source code? Other than 
harming developers' feelings, I don't see what kind of damange could that 
piece of code do.
