My concern is only that the UFS HCI driver doesn't have a way to know if
it's the new or old "type" of phy, but if you can get that working then
I don't have any objections about doing so for a transitional period.

But, you may not use kernel config options to handle this, the same
Image should boot on msm8916, msm8996 and sdm845 (with appropriate dtb
for each one).

I do not have an issue with that.
