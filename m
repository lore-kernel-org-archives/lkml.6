This isn't really useful without a full backtrace.

It's definitely the cheapest way. Getting AC PHY into anything usable
(proper setup that will allow Tx & Rx anything) would probably take
weeks or months of development. I'm not even going to estimate cost of
adding support for 802.11n and 802.11ac features. I was the last
person actively working on b43, right now I spend my free time on
other hobby projects. Few people were planning to help but it seems it
never worked out for them.
