I guess in most cases these ranges will be static at least during one
boot. But it still feels like this should be removed when the driver
goes away. While this may not depend on data by the driver, and hence
won't cause a crash or anything, it just seems wrong to leave it
around when the driver no longer isn't.

Okay, I can turn this into a proper patch to fix this up. I suspect that
other drivers may be subject to the same regression. For the longer term
I think it'd be better to properly undo the registration on failure and
removal, but I suspect that it'd be quite a bit of work and not suitable
for v4.17 anymore.

I'm sure it'd be possible. But it would be quite involved, I think. The
reason the code is the way it is is because parsing the DT didn't use to
have side-effects.

Also, I don't think it would buy us much because the probe can still
defer (or at least fail) as late as pci_scan_root_bus_bridge(). Even if
we work around the probe deferral by moving the DT parsing to a later
point we could easily run into a situation where the entry remains in
place and a subsequent attempt to reload the driver would then fail in
the same way as if we were deferring probe.
