Subject: [PATCH 19/21] regulator: fixed/gpio: Update device tree bindings

Deprecate the open drain binding for fixed regulator and indicate
that we prefer this to be passed in the GPIO phandle flags.

Clarify that the line inversion semantics for fixed and GPIO
regulators completely overrides the active low flags in the
phandle flags.

Unfortunately this can not be changed to prefer that we pass
the flags in the phandle: the bindings have been specified and
deployed such that the presence/absence of this flag and only
that controls the line inversion semantics. The crucial semantic
is that the absence of the flag means the core will assume
the line is active low, which in GPIO terms is an exception,
as GPIO lines are normally assumed to be active high.

This special device tree semantic cannot be changed without
introducing a whole new compatible string for the fixed and
GPIO regulators, so we just contain the situation.
