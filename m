My intent here was to have this handle wraparound using the same sort of
method that the time_before/time_after macros do. Obviously, I didn't
document that well.

I want to make sure I understand what's actually broken here thoug. Is
it only broken when the two values are more than 2**63 apart, or is
there something else more fundamentally wrong here?

I think I'll just make it return a boolean value like you suggested
first. I'll send a patch to fix it once I've done some basic testing
with it.
