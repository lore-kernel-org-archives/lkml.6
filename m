My guess would be that it is not random stack garbage that is being
put in the read. If the read buffer was not initialized it will
contain random data. I suspect that is what we are likely seeing is
the use of uninitialized memory for the read buffer.

There should already be a fix for this that was added in commit
1c7de2b4ff88 "PCI: Enable access to non-standard VPD for Chelsio
devices (cxgb3)". If you are missing device IDs you need to add them
to the existing quirk in order to make certain all your devices are
covered. Just adding the quirk to your driver won't fix the issue.
Adding a workaround to KVM that allows for you to circumvent this
would just make for a huge security hole since as I recall one of the
reasons why we were putting the limits on this in the first place was
because access to uninitialized VPD memory on some devices was causing
some pretty serious issues.
