Thanks a lot for testing.

MI stands for Maintenance Interrupts. Life is too short to write that
all the time ;-)

You can't. None of the kernel is mapped at EL2 on pre-VHE hardware.
You'll need to find indirect ways of outputting information (store data
in memory, and output it once you're back to EL1).
