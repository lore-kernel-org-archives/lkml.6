I do not want to allow GUP to pin I/O space this would open a pandora
box that we do not want to open at all. Many driver manage their IO
space and if they get random pinning because some other kernel bits
they never heard of starts to do GUP on their stuff it is gonna cause
havoc.

So far mmap of device file have always been special and it has been
reflected to userspace in all the instance i know of (media and GPU).
Pretending we can handle them like any other vma is a lie because
they were never designed that way in the first place and it would be
disruptive to all those driver.

Minimum disruption with minimun changes is what we should aim for and
is what i am trying to do with this patchset. Using struct page and
allowing GUP would mean rewritting huge chunk of GPU drivers (pretty
much rewritting their whole memory management) with no benefit at the
end.

When something is special it is better to leave it that way.

Cheers,
Jérôme
