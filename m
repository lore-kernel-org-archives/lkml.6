I imagine the error would be -EPERM rather than -ESRCH in this case,
which would be incredibly trivial for userspace to differentiate
between. If you wish to re-open the path that is also trivial by
re-opening through /proc/self/fd/$fd -- which will re-do any permission
checks and will guarantee that you are re-opening the same 'struct file'
and thus the same 'struct pid'.

I think that the error separation above would trivially allow user-space
to know whether the identity or capability of a process being monitored
has changed.

Currently, all operations on a '/proc/$pid' which you've previously
opened and has died will give you -ESRCH. So the above separation I
mentioned is entirely consistent with how users are using '/proc/$pid'
to check for PID death today.

Yeah, for this reason I think that using -EPERM on operations that we
think are not reasonable to allow possibly-less-privileged processes to
do -- probably the most reasonable choice would be ptrace_may_access().

Well, if we consider wait4(2) it seems that this is already the case.
If you fork+exec a setuid binary you can definitely see its exit code.

One question I have about EOF-on-exit is that if we wish to extend it to
allow providing the exit status (which is something we discussed in the
original thread), how will multiple-readers be handled in such a
scenario? Would we be storing the exit status or siginfo in the
equivalent of a locked memfd?
