This is technically incorrect, even for reading, you need a page, which could be 
common zero page in certain cases.

Again we are exaggerating (from technical correctness POV) - if user pointer was 
bogs, the read would not have worked in first place etc. So lets tone down the 
rhetoric.

Lets see if this warrants adding complexity ! This implies that TLB entry with 
Read permissions didn't exist for reading the var and page fault handler could not 
wire up even a zero page due to preempt_disable, meaning it was something not 
touched by userspace already - sort of uninitialized variable in user code. 
Otherwise it is extremely unlikely to start with a TLB entry with Read 
permissions, followed by syscall Trap only to find the entry missing, unless a 
global TLB flush came from other cores, right in the middle. But this syscall is 
not guaranteed to work with SMP anyways, so lets ignore any SMP misdoings here.

Now in case it was *an* uninitialized var, do we have to guarantee any well 
defined semantics for the kernel emulation of cmpxchg ? IMO it should be fine to 
return 0 or -EFAULT etc. Infact -EFAULT is better as it will force a retry loop on 
user side, given the typical cmpxchg usage pattern.
