The vma would still be locked so we would effectively turn it into
ONFAULT IIRC.

So can we start discussing whether we want to allow MADV_DONTNEED on
mlocked areas and what downsides it might have? Sure it would turn the
strong mlock guarantee to have the whole vma resident but is this
acceptable for something that is an explicit request from the owner of
the memory?
