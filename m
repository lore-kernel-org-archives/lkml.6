Right; we should be doing a config read to the device, but apparently
we don't get a response so we think it's not there.  It's still
conceivable there's some hotplug or power management wrinkle that we
aren't handling correctly, but those things are used on many systems,
so it would have to be a fairly esoteric issue.
