The plan was to disable trapping, yes. However, after that thread there
was a retrospective change applied to the architecture, such that the
XPACLRI (and XPACD/XPACI) instructions are no longer trapped by
HCR_EL2.API. (The public documentation on this has not been updated
yet.) This means that no HINT-space instructions should trap anymore.
(The guest is expected to not set SCTLR_EL1.EnI{A,B} since
ID_AA64ISAR1_EL1.{APA,API} read as 0.)

Changed it to "a trapped ptrauth instruction".
