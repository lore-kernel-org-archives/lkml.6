Hi,

well, it indeed fixes the reported problem, thanks.
But I just tested the first (dm.c) change above.

The important part is also that if the error is hits bio later, it will produce
short read (and not fail of the whole operation), this can be easily tested if we switch
the error and the zero target in that reproducer
  //system("echo -e \'0 10000000 error\'\\\\n\'10000000 1000000 zero\' | dmsetup create test");
  system("echo -e \'0 10000000 zero\'\\\\n\'10000000 1000000 error\' | dmsetup create test");

So it seems your patch works.

I am not sure about this part though:

Shouldn't it be
	if (!parent->bi_status && bio->bi_status)
  		parent->bi_status = bio->bi_status;
?

Maybe one rephrased question: what about priorities for errors (bio statuses)?

For example, part of a bio fails with EILSEQ (data integrity check error, BLK_STS_PROTECTION),
part with EIO (media error, BLK_STS_IOERR). What should be reported for parent bio?
(I would expect I always get EIO here because this is hard, uncorrectable error.)

Anyway, thanks for the fix!
