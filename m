Not being sure is different than being certain. As Andy noted, if that does
not work please poke Andy about the SHA-256 API he has which would enable
its use in kernel.

Right now this is just a crazy hack for *2* drivers. Its a lot of hacks for
just that, so no need to rush this in just yet. It seems unclear if we're
all happy with this yet as well.
