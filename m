My comment was that the changelog didn't match the code.  I don't know
which one is wrong, so I wasn't trying to suggest that you change the
code.  If the code is right and the changelog is wrong, just change
the changelog.

Hmmm, are you suggesting that if we went this quirk route, we'd be
updating the quirk frequently to add new devices?

I'm opposed to that as a strategy because it makes needless work.  You
have to update the quirk, backport it to older kernels, re-release
distro kernels, etc.

If this situation is going to happen frequently, it would be better to
(a) fix the firmware defect (if that's what this is) or (b) pursue
some APST or other spec change so there's a generic documented way to
handle this without requiring device-specific quirks.
