Hi Linus,

Can you please pull update containing a rework of the VFS clone and
dedupe file range infrastructure from the tag listed below?

We discovered many issues with these interfaces late in the 4.19
cycle - the worst of them (data corruption, setuid stripping) were
fixed for XFS in 4.19-rc8, but a larger rework of the infrastructure
fixing all the problems was needed. That rework is the contents of
this pull request.

The base tree is 4.19 because there was an unrelated
vfs_clone_file_range API cleanup merged in v4.19-rc7, and combined
with the mods in 4.19-rc8 it was simpler for everyone to base this
work on a tree with all those changes already in it.

There is a simple conflict with your current tree in
Documentation/filesystems/porting. However, if you pull Al's pending
VFS tree before this there will also be a more significant conflict
fs/read_write.c in the vfs_dedupe_file_range_one() function rework.
The details of the conflict  and the resolution that the linux-next
tree is carrying can be found here:

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20181031115247.6adcb659@canb.auug.org.au/

If you need any more info or a tree with the conflicts already
resolved, please let me know.

Thanks,

Dave.

PS. Darrick is back up to speed so the next XFS pull request for
fixes later in the -rc cycle will probably come from him again.

  xfs: remove [cm]time update from reflink calls (2018-10-30 10:47:48 +1100)

----------------------------------------------------------------
vfs: rework data cloning infrastructure

Rework the vfs_clone_file_range and vfs_dedupe_file_range infrastructure to use
a common .remap_file_range method and supply generic bounds and sanity checking
functions that are shared with the data write path. The current VFS
infrastructure has problems with rlimit, LFS file sizes, file time stamps,
maximum filesystem file sizes, stripping setuid bits, etc and so they are
addressed in these commits.

We also introduce the ability for the ->remap_file_range methods to return short
clones so that clones for vfs_copy_file_range() don't get rejected if the entire
range can't be cloned. It also allows filesystems to sliently skip deduplication
of partial EOF blocks if they are not capable of doing so without requiring
errors to be thrown to userspace.

All existing filesystems are converted to user the new .remap_file_range method,
and both XFS and ocfs2 are modified to make use of the new generic checking
infrastructure.
