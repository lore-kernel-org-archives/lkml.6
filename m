Actually, it is fair, because:

        /* proportion the scan between the caches */
        dentries = mult_frac(sc->nr_to_scan, dentries, total_objects);
        inodes = mult_frac(sc->nr_to_scan, inodes, total_objects);
        fs_objects = mult_frac(sc->nr_to_scan, fs_objects, total_objects);

This means that if the number of objects in the memcg aware VFS
caches are tiny compared to the global XFS inode cache, then they
only get a tiny amount of the total scanning done by the shrinker.

And because all of the memcg shrinkers walk the global inode cache,
the overall scanning is shared between all memcgs under memory
pressure evenly and so none are unfairly penalised by having to
scan the global inode cache to trigger final garbage collection.

If you just look at a single memcg and shrinker in isolation, then
you are missing the forest for the trees...

That's a bit extreme.

I expect people who are trying to fix bugs in complex subsystems
to be able to explain what the bug is they are fixing, what impact
it has and how they observed/measured the impact. Especially for
somethign as critical as shrinker infrastructure - if we screw up the
calculations we'll break systems everywhere and when we have to fix
those bugs we need to know why those changes were made. That means
the reasons for making the change (i.e. what problem was being
fixed) needs to be documented in the commit message.

Speaking as the original author of the list_lru infrastructure for
shrinkers, you've got that all back to front. The list_lru was
developed specifically for XFS scalibilty and performance reasons
i.e. SHRINKER_NUMA_AWARE.

The memcg stuff was tacked onto the side of the list-lrus later on
as it was a convenient abstraction to hide the bogosities of memcg
accounting and reclaim from the rest of the mm subsystem.  IOWs, the
memcg infrastructure is the exception case here, not XFS....

Cheers,

Dave.
