Please look again. The stub version of cc_is_hw_key() doing that is being
replaced in this patch.

The s390 key and the cryptocell keys are not the same:

Their is, I believe, is an AES key encrypted by some internal key/algorithm.

The cryptocell "key" is a token, which is internally comprised of one
or two indexes, referencing slots in the internal memory in the
hardware, and a key size, that describe the size of the key.

I thought it would be confusing to use "paes" to describe both, since
they are not interchangeable.
You would not be able to feed an paes key that works with the s390
version to cryptocell and vice verse and get it work.

Having said, if you prefer to have "paes" simply designate
"implementation specific token for an AES key" I'm perfectly fine with
that.

As noted above, the haes "key" is really a token encoding 3 different
pieces of information:
1. The index of the first key slot to use
2. Potentially, the index of a 2nd key slot to use (for XTS)
3. a key size, denoting the actual key size used, not the slot number

I than have to parse this information encoded in the token and feed it
to the HW (via 3 different registers)

Therefore, I do not see how I can avoid parsing the token.

I hope I've managed to explain things better now.

Thanks,
Gilad
