Per my understanding, mediatek's Root Port does not claim anything, or
it's fine to assign no resource which is dedicated to this bridge. Those
information could be got through lspci output which is attached in the
last mail. All the resource it claimed is from the subordinate device,
bridge itself does not need any special resource.

I was not get to that far, I just want to start a discussion about this,
since spec does not forbidden subtractive bridge to support port
service.

Thanks.
