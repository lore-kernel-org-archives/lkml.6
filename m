Hi Milan,
I will run veritysetup test on next version of these patches and contact you about verity-compat-test testsuits.
Thank you,
Yael

Mike and others,

did anyone even try to run veritysetup tests?

We have verity-compat-test in our testsuite, is has even basic FEC tests included.

We just added userspace verification of FEC RS codes to compare if kernel behaves the same.

I tried to apply three last dm-verity patches from your tree to Linus mainline.

It does even pass the *first* line of the test script and blocks the kernel forever...
(Running on 32bit Intel VM.)

*NACK* to the last two dm-verity patches.

(The "validate hashes once" is ok, despite I really do not like this approach...)

And comments from Eric are very valid as well, I think all this need to be fixed before it can go to mainline.

Thanks,
Milan
