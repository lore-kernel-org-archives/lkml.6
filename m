So "L" literals map to wchar_t, which wide character type is implementation 
specific IIRC, could be 16-bit or 32-bit wide.

u"" literals OTOH are specified by the C11 spec to be char16_t, i.e. 16-bit wide 
characters - which I assume is the EFI type as well?

Yes, my guess is that those problems were due to L"xyz" mapping to wchar_t and 
having a different type in the kernel build and the host build side - but u"xyz" 
should solve that.
