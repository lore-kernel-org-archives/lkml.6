Looking at the smartctl SCSI code it pulls 32 byte sense buffers.
Can't see 22 anywhere relevant in its code.

There are two types of sense: fixed and descriptor: with fixed you
seldom need more than 18 bytes (but it can only represent 32 bit
LBAs). The other type has a header and 0 or more variable length
descriptors. If decoding of descriptor sense went wrong you might
end up at offset 94. But not with smartctl ....
