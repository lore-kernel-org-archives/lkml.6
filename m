static and, even more, inlined static functions are not API, if found in
the .c file.

genalloc is not a security module :-P

it seems to be used in various places and for different purposes, also
depending on the architecture

For this reason I'm reluctant to add overhead.

ok, fair enough

so I'll make sue that the API does sanitation

it's static, therefore no API

ok, I can add the explanation
which is: the corresponding memory is allocated when a pool is created.
should the allocation fail, the pool creation will fail consequently

The only cases which can cause this to be NULL within a pool are:
* accidental corruption
* attacker tampering with kernel memory

However they are both quite unlikely:
* accidental corruption should not happen so easily and, in case it
happens, it's likely to plow also some surrounding memory.
* this is just metadata, supposed to be useful mostly before the pool is
write-protected. If an attacker is capable of altering arbitrary kernel
data memory, there are far better targets.

I'll figure out which alternative I dislike the least :-)

Probably just fix the data types in a separate patch.
This patch for genalloc has generated various comments which are
actually more about the original implementation than what I'm adding.
