Then why even care about this call at all?  If you need to really know
if the read worked, you have to check the value.  If the value is FF
then you have a huge hint that the hardware is now gone.  And you can
rely on it being gone, you can never rely on making the call to the
function to check if the hardware is there to be still valid any point
in time after the call returns.

You are not "interacting", you are reading/writing to the hardware, as
you have to do so.  So I really don't understand what you are talking
about here, sorry.
