While time goes, I got another simpler idea how we should settle this:

1. Since we are know that by nature RSA sign/verify is just encrypt/decrypt,
and since sign/verify calls should not be used directly by any normal
users:
- Remove sign/verify calls from all existing RSA backends.

2. pkcs1pad should use encrypt/decrypt API for its low level purposes
(instead of sign/verify API, which now would be not implemented by them),
and provide sign (same as before) and new verify (returning only status).

Thus, we avoid verify_rsa call altogether while remaining its
functionality, and skipping conversion step.

Well, if we allowed to reuse dst* fields why not just put digest over
dst scatterlist? That would be much simpler.

Thanks,
