The SoC might support a specific mode like HS200. So the SoC specific dtsi file
might have dt properties for HS200 mode set. But the board which uses the SoC
might be modeled in a way a particular mode cannot be used (like IO lines not
connected to 1.8v). One option is to use /delete-property/ in the board dts
file. But since "no-1-8-v" property already indicates HS200 mode cannot be
supported, having a /delete-property/ might be redundant.

I can reset caps2 in sdhci-omap after invoking mmc_of_parse if you feel that
makes more sense.

Thanks
Kishon
