I think the AAPCS permits the compiler to allocate the stack space for
outgoing variables (i.e., args 9 and beyond or other argument types
that require passing via the stack) at a smaller scope than the entire
function, although GCC does appear to allocate it at the beginning
(based on some quick experiments)
