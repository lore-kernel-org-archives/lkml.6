I would argue this type of message/record should be converted to an
accompanied syscall record, or have the subject attributes added to the
record so that it is clear what user/process initiated this action.  It
now occurs to me that to save audit communications and disk bandwidth,
one syscall record could accompany all the rule records, but if the list
is long enough it might overwhelm userspace audit event parsing code.
Steve?

Regardless, the ima_parse_rule() record format needs to be fixed to
address the non-standard use of "<" and ">" operators instead of the
standard "=" field/value separator.

Ok, so this might be one circumstance where the container id field
could make sense to include it in the primary record, but it will
already be automatically getting an AUDIT_CONTAINER_INFO record by
virtue of being a syscall auxiliary record.  You say "These records are
probably being used independently of any other audit records.", but
unless you are certain these are not used by any other tools, it will
have to remain as a syscall auxiliary record.  This means it will
duplicate the container id info if the container id field is added to
the AUDIT_INTEGRITY_RULE record or cause your tools to need to be able
to parse audit *events* rather than just individual audit *records* to
get the associated container id if the container id field is not added
to the AUDIT_INTEGRITY_RULE.

This makes sense to me, but will depend on other users of this record
type.  Since there are already two very different formats for this one
existing record type, changing the record type either doesn't matter if
nothing else has noticed or this is what triggered the examination of
this issue in the first place and should be fixed.
