I guess the contrast you're making is between drivers/acpi/pci_root.c,
which claims ACPI PNP0A03 and PNP0A08 devices, and what I call the
"native" host bridge drivers, which normally claim DT platform devices
and know about the register layout and programming model of those
devices?

In both cases the PCI core has to know about the host bridge apertures
(the address ranges on the primary (upstream) side of the host bridge
that are translated to PCI addresses on the secondary (downstream)
side of the bridge).

I'm still not seeing the connection between the ACPI/native
distinction or the host bridge apertures and this AER enablement
issue.  But I think the problem has to do with the ordering between
enumeration and portdrv/AER driver binding.  See below.

It seems clear enough to me that this is broken; I don't think we need
more testing to confirm it.  Your scenario below looks like it's
probably from VMD, given the domain number, and the fact that the
timestamps look like they're after boot suggests that VMD is being
loaded as a module.

I think I can work out the order of events there:

  - register pcie_portdriver   # device_initcall
  - register aerdriver         # device_initcall, after portdrv
  - load VMD module
  - add VMD host bridge to domain 10000
  - 10000:00:00.0: enumerate VMD root port
  - 10000:00:00.0: bind portdrv, disable error reporting
  - 10000:00:00.0: bind aerdriver, enable error reporting for children
  - 10000:01:00.0: enumerate VMD switch upstream port
  - 10000:01:00.0: bind portdrv, disable error reporting
  - 10000:01:00.0: do not bind AER driver (because not a root port)
  - 10000:02:0x.0: enumerate VMD switch downstream ports
  - 10000:02:0x.0: bind portdrv, disable error reporting
  - 10000:02:0x.0: do not bind AER driver (not root ports)
  - 10000:06:00.0: enumerate NVMe endpoint
  - 10000:06:00.0: nvme driver enables error reporting

The end state is that error reporting is enabled only for the root
port and the NVMe device, but not for the switch ports in between.

I think the critical ordering is the portdrv/AER driver registration
vs. the device enumeration.  If we enumerate the devices before
registering portdrv/AER (as is the typical case with ACPI host
bridges), when we register portdrv, we'll bind portdrv to all the
bridges *first*, which disables error reporting for all of them.

After that, we'll register the AER driver, which will be bound to all
the root ports and will enable error reporting for the subtrees below
them.

We should execute the statement above for all root ports, switch
upstream ports, and switch downstream ports, regardless of how they
were discovered.

I think the real issue is that if we register the drivers first, we
bind portdrv/AER to devices as they're enumerated.  But if we
enumerate the devices first, we bind portdrv to all of them first,
following by binding the AER driver to the root ports.  That ordering
difference explains the problem.

I agree, this is sort of a mess.  It would be nice if the AER code
could take care of this for all devices relevant to AER.  But the
portdrv structure is such that it can only bind to *ports*, not to
endpoints.  So there's not really a good way for the current AER
service driver to get involved when an endpoint is discovered.

Sorry for the wall of text above.  Here's a proposal for an alternate
way to solve this by doing more of it in the AER driver.  Obviously I
can't test this so I don't know if it will solve the problem for you.

commit 15a6711649915ca3e9d1086dc88ff4b616b99aac
Author: Bjorn Helgaas <bhelgaas@google.com>

    PCI/AER: Enable reporting for ports enumerated after AER driver registration
    
    Previously we enabled AER error reporting only for Switch Ports that were
    enumerated prior to registering the AER service driver.  Switch Ports
    enumerated after AER driver registration were left with error reporting
    disabled.
    
    A common order, which works correctly, is that we enumerate devices before
    registering portdrv and the AER driver:
    
      - Enumerate all the devices at boot-time
    
      - Register portdrv and bind it to all Root Ports and Switch Ports, which
        disables error reporting for these Ports
    
      - Register AER service driver and bind it to all Root Ports, which
        enables error reporting for the Root Ports and any Switch Ports below
        them
    
    But if we enumerate devices *after* registering portdrv and the AER driver,
    e.g., if a host bridge driver is loaded as a module, error reporting is not
    enabled correctly:
    
      - Register portdrv and AER driver (this happens at boot-time)
    
      - Enumerate a Root Port
    
      - Bind portdrv to Root Port, disabling its error reporting
    
      - Bind AER service driver to Root Port, enabling error reporting for it
        and its children (none, since we haven't enumerated them yet)
    
      - Enumerate Switch Port below the Root Port
    
      - Bind portdrv to Switch Port, disabling its error reporting
    
      - AER service driver doesn't bind to Switch Ports, so error reporting
        remains disabled
    
    Hot-adding a Switch fails similarly: error reporting is enabled correctly
    for the Root Port, but when the Switch is enumerated, the AER service
    driver doesn't claim it, so there's nothing to enable error reporting for
    the Switch Ports.
    
    Change the AER service driver so it binds to *all* PCIe ports, including
    Switch Upstream and Downstream Ports.  For Switch Ports, enable AER error
    reporting.
