I don't think there is anything wrong with blk-iolatency. blk-iolatency
piggybacks off of the rq_qos hooks which when throttle gets called means
submit has happened on the bio. As a byproduct, all bios that
blk-iolatency sees has a blkcg associated with it from
blkcg_bio_issue_check(). This lets blk-iolatency associate a blkg in the
throttle hook - blkcg_iolatency_throttle().

Order of functions called:
  generic_make_request()
    generic_make_request_checks() <- associates blkcg
    make_request_fn() (eventually blk_mq_make_request)
      rq_qos_throttle()
        blkcg_iolatency_throttle() <- associate blkg based on blkcg

blk-throttle is another story, it kind of does association really high
up, but lets the block layer manage the request_queue and attribute it
all to the first blkg seen. I believe this is just the top level blkg
(same css, first request_queue). Disclaimer, I haven't read through much
of the blk-throttle code.

I think the interaction gets a little confusing with stacked block
devices, but regardless, shouldn't blk-iolatency care about every bio
that comes through anyway? I think this would just translate to
throttling at each request_queue and not just the entrance queue.

If a bio has a device with no request_queue, I don't think it will ever
reach blk-iolatency because the bio goes straight to device and a
requirement to get to call rq_qos_throttle is to have a request_queue.

Thanks,
Dennis
