OK, so let me summarize my remaining concerns as well. I may be a bit
more finicky than Andy, though.

First of all, the rate at which new revisions of this series are
appearing increases the review effort unnecessarily, especially given
that the latest version seemed to have some issues that would have
been spotted by a simple build test. I would like to urge Jason to
bear with us and bring this discussion to a close before resubmitting.

As far as I can tell (i.e., as a user not a network dev), WireGuard is
an excellent piece of code, and I would like to see it merged. I also
think there is little disagreement about the quality of the proposed
algorithm implementations and the usefulness of having a set of easy
to use solid crypto primitives in addition to or complementing the
current crypto API.

I do have some concerns over how the code is organized though:

* simd_relax() is currently not called by the crypto routines
themselves. This means that the worst case scheduling latency is
unbounded, which is unacceptable for the -rt kernel. The worst case
scheduling latency should never be proportional to the input size.
(Apologies for not spotting that earlier)

* Using a cute name for the crypto library [that will end up being the
preferred choice for casual use only] may confuse people, given that
we have lots of code in crypto/ already. I'd much prefer using, e.g.,
crypto/lib and crypto/api (regardless of where the arch specific
pieces live)

* I'd prefer the arch specific pieces to live under arch, but I can
live with keeping them in a single place, as long as the arch
maintainers have some kind of jurisdiction over them. I also think
there should be some overlap between the maintainership
responsibilities of the two generic pieces (api and lib).

* (Nit) The GCC command line -include'd .h files contain variable and
function definitions so they are actually .c files.

* (Nit) Referencing CONFIG_xxx macros from -include'd files adds the
implicit assumption that the -include appears after the -include of
kconfig.h.

* Adding /conditional/ -include's (or #include's) increases the size
of the validation space, which is why we generally prefer
unconditional includes (and static inline stubs), and 'if
(IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_xxx))' over #ifdef CONFIG_xxx

* The current organization of the code puts all available (for the
arch) versions of all routines into a single module, which can only be
built in once we update random.c to use Zinc's chacha20 routines. This
bloats the core kernel (which is a huge deal for embedded systems that
have very strict boot requirements). It also makes it impossible to
simply blacklist a module if you, for instance, prefer to use the
[potentially more power efficient] scalar code over the SIMD code when
using a distro kernel.

[To summarize the 4 points above, I'd much rather see a more
conventional organization where different parts are provided by
different modules. I don't think the argument that inlining is needed
for performance is actually valid, given that we have branch
predictors and static keys, and the arch SIMD code is built as
separate object files anyway]

* If we reuse source files from OpenSSL, we should use that actual
source which is the perlasm not the emitted assembler. Also, we should
work with Andy Polyakov (as I have done several times over the past 5+
years) to upstream the changes we apply to the kernel version of the
code. The same applies to code from other sources, btw, but I am not
personally familiar with them.

* If upstreaming the changes is not an option, they should be applied
as a separate patch and not hidden in a 5000 line patch without any
justification or documentation (but Jason is already working on that)
