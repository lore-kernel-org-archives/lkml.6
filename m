Yes, this is a generic problem in the PCI core.  We've tried to fix it
in the past but haven't figured it out yet.

See 40f11adc7cd9 ("PCI: Avoid race while enabling upstream bridges")
and 0f50a49e3008 ("Revert "PCI: Avoid race while enabling upstream
bridges"").

It's not trivial, but if you figure out a good way to fix this, I'd be
thrilled.
