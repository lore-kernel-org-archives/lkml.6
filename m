You're having an off day ;)  Mondays and all?

I just raised an alignment concern that needs to be considered during
review by all stakeholders.  Wasn't upset at all.  Maybe my email tone
came off otherwise?

And then you got confused by me pointing out how it was weird for you to
suggest I felt this stuff was pushed behind my back.. and went on to
think I really think that.  It's almost like you're a confused hypnotist
seeding me with paranoid dilutions. ;)

/me waits for Jens to snap his fingers so he can just slowly step away
from this line of discussion that is solidly dead now...

Cool, sounds good.

Great, thanks, do you happen to have a tree you can push so others can
get a quick compile and look at the series fully applied?

BTW, I'm upstream DM maintainer but I have a role in caring for related
subsystems (e.g. block core, etc) in downstream releases.. *cough* RHEL.
So this alignment concern wasn't ever purely about DM.
