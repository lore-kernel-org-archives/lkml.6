That's interesting.

I'm wondering if a configuration with a usage domain that is not also a
control domain is rejected outright? Anybody tried that? :)

Would you be fine if the control domain interface stated that it is
used to configure _additional_ control domains and the usage domain
interface stated that it is used to define usage and implicitly also
control domains? (And make the usage domain interface also set the
equivalent bit in the control domain mask.)

I guess it depends:

- If this is a case of: "Don't configure control domains that are not
  also usage domains. You are likely to go through
  {code,firmware,hardware} paths that are generally not used.",
  configure it in the kernel.
- If this rather is "Everybody is doing that, it's a general
  convention.", configure it higher up in the stack (libvirt?)
