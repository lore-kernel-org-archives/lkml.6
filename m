This looks neat!

I have a few minor comments below.

I suspect we want to avoid the full set of instrumentation suspects here, e.g.
GKOV, KASAN, UBSAN, and KCOV.

Nit: The rest of our asm macros are lower-case -- can we stick to that here?

I believe we also need this in ret_fast_syscall.

I wonder if end_of_stack() should be taught about CONFIG_SCHED_STACK_END_CHECK,
given that's supposed to return the last *usable* long on the stack, and we
don't account for this elsewhere.

If we did, then IIUC we could do:

	unsigned long boundary = (unsigned long)end_of_stack(current);

... at the start of the function, and not have to worry about this explicitly.

I worry a little that the compiler can move the SP during a function's
lifetime, but maybe that's only the case when there are VLAs, or something like
that?

Once this function returns, its data is left on the stack. Is that not a problem?

No strong feelings either way, but it might be worth mentioning in the commit
message.

Nit: end_of_stack(p) would be slightly better semantically, even though
currently equivalent to task_stack_page(p).

Is this arbitrary, or is there something special about 256?

Even if this is arbitrary, can we give it some mnemonic?

I believe we'll also need to do this for the KVM hyp code in arch/arm64/kvm/hyp/.

Thanks,
Mark.
