I've staged the changes to send to Linus shortly.

The first patch has:

Fixes: 569d0365f571 ("dax: require 'struct page' by default for filesystem dax")
Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org

As that is the right thing to do given the other 2 patches are marked
for stable.  We don't want to have a stable kernel with the last 2
patches but not the first.
