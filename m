I was wondering why you thought I was suspicious. It's a recent =0A=

I don't think ignoring the field is a problem:=0A=

=0A=
In the latter case we decide whether to use AER, independent of the crap =
=0A=
in ACPI. I'm not even sure why "Enabled" matters in native AER handling. =
=0A=

I think HPX carries the same sort of information (except for Root =0A=
Command reg). FW is supposed to program those registers anyway, so even =0A=
if OS doesn't touch them, I'd expect things to just work.=0A=

_HPX type 3 (yay!!!) got approved recently, and that will have more =0A=
fine-grained control. It will be able to handle root control reg.=0A=

=0A=
My understanding is that, if FW keeps control of AER in _OSC, then it =0A=
will have set things up to get notified instead of the OS. OSPM not =0A=
touching AER bits is to make sure it doesn't mess up FW's setup. I think =
=0A=
there are some proprietary bits in the root port to route interrupts to =0A=
SMIs instead of the AER vectors.=0A=
