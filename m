I'm all for documenting this primarily to prevent folks from just adding 
whatever they wish in /aliases. Some platforms seem to want to have 
aliases for everything.

This basically matches my opinion on aliases.
 
I'd decouple it from board labels a bit. Sometimes the numbering may 
match, but others not. What if a board serial port is labeled "DBG" for 
example? I think 'label' is the right way to handle human identifible 
ports (and then we should have something like /dev/serial/by-label/...).

Agreed. I guess the question is what to do on used, but not recommended 
aliases. I would put SPI and I2C into that category BTW.
