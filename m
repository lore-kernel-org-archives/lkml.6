No, I injected the fault on purpose to simulate the case when size is less than
PAGE_SIZE(eg. PAGE_SIZE-0x200=65024)
I ever got the panic info [1] *without* the debugging patch only once

Yes, I understand what the codes did in hva_to_gfn_memslot(). What I mean is
hva_end may be changed and (hva_end - hva_start) will not be same as the
parameter _size_ ?

>ret |= handler(kvm, gpa, (u64)(hva_end - hva_start), data);

Anyway, I have to admit that all the exceptions are originally caused by the
STABLE_FLAG in ksm code. What I want to discuss here is how to make arm kvm
handle the exception more gracefully.
