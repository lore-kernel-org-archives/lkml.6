I'm not very sympathetic to this argument about NVMe endpoints not
supporting Relaxed Ordering.  Relaxed Ordering has been in the PCIe
spec since the very beginning in 2002 (see PCIe r1.0, sec 2.4.3).  Why
should we jump through hoops to tack this on after the fact if the
endpoint designer couldn't be bothered?

This sysfs knob is problematic because it's not safe and it can't
be supported across architectures.

It's not safe because only the endpoint and its driver know the
ordering requirements.  We *hope* the user only enables relaxed
ordering when it is safe.  Even when it's not safe, it makes things
faster and works most of the time, so it's pretty tempting.  But
eventually it will lead to data corruption.

We try to avoid sysfs things that are architecture-specific.  This
particular file would only exist on iProc, and then any user-space
software that uses it would only work on iProc.
