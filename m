Correct, and that's why the MIC "Virtio-over-PCIe framework" does not
try to implement the standard "Virtio Over PCI Bus".  (Yes, it's
confusing.)

The mic/vop code already does this.  See
Documentation/mic/mic_overview.txt for some information.

I came to essentialy the same conclusions before I found the MIC code.

(Your "aside" in that email about virtio doing PCIe reads instead of
 writes is not solved by the MIC code, since that is how the standard
 virtio devices/drivers work.)
