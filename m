Hm, the current code does a quick exit if bit 76 is not set, doesn't
it?

With the format selection you outlined above, I guess. Makes sense from
my point of view (just looking at the source code).

But would it actually make sense to tie vfio-ap to APXA? This needs to
be answered by folks with access to the architecture :)

[Personally, I think we should go with the version that uses the least
restrictions without introducing over-complex code. What constitutes
"over-complex code" is of course in the eye of the beholder...]
