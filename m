Roughly speaking, we have two categories: An asynchronous function is
performed (SSCH, HSCH, CSCH) or not (XSCH). So I would split out XSCH
in any case.

SSCH, HSCH, CSCH all perform path management. I see them as kind of
escalating (i.e. CSCH 'beats' HSCH which 'beats' SSCH). I think they
are all similar enough, though, as we can call through to the real
hardware and have it sorted out there.

Looking through the channel I/O instructions:
- RSCH should be handled with SSCH (as a special case).
- MSCH should also be handled in the long run, STSCH as well.
- SCHM is interesting, as it's not per-subchannel. We have some basic
  handling of the instruction in QEMU, but it only emulates some ssch
  counters and completely lacks support for the other fields.
- IIRC, there's also a CHSC command dealing with channel monitoring. We
  currently fence off any CHSC that is not needed for Linux to run, but
  there are some that might be useful for the guest (path handling
  etc.) Hard to come to a conclusion here without access to the
  documentation.
- I don't think we need to care about TSCH (other than keeping the
  schib up to date, which we also need to do for STSCH).
- Likewise, TPI should be handled via emulation.

Coming back to the original issue, I think we can easily handle SSCH
(and RSCH), HSCH and CSCH together (with the actual hardware doing the
heavy lifting anyway). For other instructions, we need separate
states/processing.
