Euh ... Here patch adds _PAGE_COHERENT

_PAGE_USER was added some time ago.

Well, we have three cases:

BOOK3S64 and NOHASH32/8xx has _PAGE_PRIVILEGED and no _PAGE_USER
BOOKE has both _PAGE_PRIVILEGED and _PAGE_USER
Others have _PAGE_USER and no _PAGE_PRIVILEGED

So when giving user rights to a page, some will set _PAGE_USER, some 
will unset _PAGE_PRIVILEGED and some will do both.

_PAGE_USER and _PAGE_PRIVILEGED being used outside of the subarch headers,
- either we have to add uggly ifdefs
- or we can just make sure unused flags are set as 0, then  (x | 0) and 
(x & ~0) will do nothing and will be eliminated by the compiler.

Today, this is done in asm/pte-common.h. Unfortunately, all headers 
except book3s64 do include pte-common.

Another solution would be to make sure _PAGE_xxx flags are not used 
outside of subarch specific headers. That would mean having specific 
helpers defined in each subarch header, but is it really worth it ?




Lets take the exemple of an even more tricky one :
- Some subarchs have _PAGE_RW, others have _PAGE_RO instead. In 
addition, the 8xx has _PAGE_NA
- Book3s64 has _PAGE_READ and _PAGE_WRITE.
- In some places, _PAGE_RW has been redefined has _PAGE_READ | _PAGE_WRITE

It has really become pretty complex. Why having defined new flags 
instead of using _PAGE_RO for _PAGE_READ and _PAGE_RW for _PAGE_READ | 
_PAGE_WRITE ? Does it make any sense to have the possibility to set 
_PAGE_WRITE without _PAGE_READ ?


I feel like having simple generic code like:

	flags = (flags & ~_PAGE_PRIVILEGED) | _PAGE_USER;

is better than having almost same code duplicated in several places or 
ugly ifdefs like:

#if defined(CONFIG_BOOK3S64) || defined(CONFIG_PPC_8xx) || defined 
(CONFIG_BOOKE)
	flags &= ~_PAGE_PRIVILEGED;
#endif
#if !defined(CONFIG_BOOK3S64) && !defined(CONFIG_PPC_8xx)
	flags |= _PAGE_USER;
#endif


It looks to me that patch 
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=812fadcb941a81d1f3948b10a95a4dce663da3e4 
allowed a nice code simplification, don't you feel the same ?
