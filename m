Thanks for the suggestion; I'll replace this with a patch that re-enables
preemption every 4 KiB encrypted.  That also avoids having to do a
kernel_fpu_begin(), kernel_fpu_end() pair just for hchacha_block_ssse3().  But
yes, I'd definitely like repeated kernel_fpu_begin(), kernel_fpu_end() to not be
incredibly slow.  That would help in a lot of other places too.
