OK, I understand where you're coming from, but I find your terminology
a bit confusing :)

Maybe call the state that is tracked by the vfio driver "vfio device
state"?

Ah, now I understand where the disconnect here came from: Your patch 7
changed this :)

I have to think further about this (still undecided).

That's again the terminology confusion from above.

And this was again /me looking at the current code.

I'm wondering if it should. Having an mdev is a prereq for any setup.
So a device in not oper state without mdev is a different thing from a
device in not oper state with an mdev that received e.g. some path
failures.

The last one is possibly a bit unintuitive (might be a naming issue).

Hm, let's assume the hardware device is not operational (cc 3 on ssch
or whatever).

What I'd assume to happen would be:
- The vfio driver notices that the subchannel is not operational, and
  switches state or flips an indication somewhere.
- The vfio driver is probably also notified by the common I/O layer
  (because of machine check on the hardware). It has two choices: give
  up on the device (the common I/O layer will deregister the device),
  or keep it (which would mean something similar to the disconnected
  state for ccw devices; I guess that is what you meant with 'the
  driver is operational'?).
- If the (subchannel) device is gone, the child mdev should be gone as
  well.

What would be the best way to interact with the guest? On real
hardware, I'd expect both cc 3 and crws. Regardless whether we
unregister or do something like the disconnected state, we should relay
the cc 3 to the guest *and* inject a machine check to kick the guest's
handling.

If we use the disconnected state approach, what should the guest get if
it tries to interact with the device anyway? We could answer with cc 3
immediately, or let the hardware give us the cc 3 that we relay back to
the guest. (We should get a notification from the common I/O layer when
it is informed via a machine check that the device is alive again.)

What do you think?

See above... we can get the machine checks, but the guest can't.

Is anyone at IBM picking up this work?

The main thing missing is probably machine check handling. But probably
msch passthrough as well.

Agreed.

Path handling is sometimes a bit odd...

Yes, that should be a different series, as it will probably be quite
complex and needs thought. Anyway, I've updated
https://wiki.qemu.org/ToDo/Channel_I/O_Passthrough with some machine
check considerations.
