We report the crash: KASAN: null-ptr-deref Read in rds_ib_get_mr

Note that this bug is previously reported by syzkaller.
https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?id=0bb56a5a48b000b52aa2b0d8dd20b1f545214d91
Nonetheless, this bug has not fixed yet, and we hope that this report and our
analysis, which gets help by the RaceFuzzer's feature, will helpful to fix the
crash.

This crash has been found in v4.17-rc1 using RaceFuzzer (a modified
version of Syzkaller), which we describe more at the end of this
report. Our analysis shows that the race occurs when invoking two
syscalls concurrently, bind$rds and setsockopt$RDS_GET_MR.


Analysis:
We think the concurrent execution of __rds_rdma_map() and rds_bind()
causes the problem. __rds_rdma_map() checks whether rs->rs_bound_addr is 0
or not. But the concurrent execution with rds_bind() can by-pass this
check. Therefore, __rds_rdmap_map() calls rs->rs_transport->get_mr() and
rds_ib_get_mr() causes the null deref at ib_rdma.c:544 in v4.17-rc1, when
dereferencing rs_conn.


Thread interleaving:
CPU0 (__rds_rdma_map)					CPU1 (rds_bind)
							// rds_add_bound() sets rs->bound_addr as none 0
							ret = rds_add_bound(rs, sin->sin_addr.s_addr, &sin->sin_port);
if (rs->rs_bound_addr == 0 || !rs->rs_transport) {
	ret = -ENOTCONN; /* XXX not a great errno */
	goto out;
}
							if (rs->rs_transport) { /* previously bound */
								trans = rs->rs_transport;
								if (trans->laddr_check(sock_net(sock->sk),
										       sin->sin_addr.s_addr) != 0) {
									ret = -ENOPROTOOPT;
									// rds_remove_bound() sets rs->bound_addr as 0
									rds_remove_bound(rs);
...
trans_private = rs->rs_transport->get_mr(sg, nents, rs,
					 &mr->r_key);
(in rds_ib_get_mr())
struct rds_ib_connection *ic = rs->rs_conn->c_transport_data;


Call sequence (v4.17-rc1):
CPU0
rds_setsockopt
	rds_get_mr
		__rds_rdma_map
			rds_ib_get_mr


CPU1
rds_bind
	rds_add_bound
	...
	rds_remove_bound

= About RaceFuzzer

RaceFuzzer is a customized version of Syzkaller, specifically tailored
to find race condition bugs in the Linux kernel. While we leverage
many different technique, the notable feature of RaceFuzzer is in
leveraging a custom hypervisor (QEMU/KVM) to interleave the
scheduling. In particular, we modified the hypervisor to intentionally
stall a per-core execution, which is similar to supporting per-core
breakpoint functionality. This allows RaceFuzzer to force the kernel
to deterministically trigger racy condition (which may rarely happen
in practice due to randomness in scheduling).

RaceFuzzer's C repro always pinpoints two racy syscalls. Since C
repro's scheduling synchronization should be performed at the user
space, its reproducibility is limited (reproduction may take from 1
second to 10 minutes (or even more), depending on a bug). This is
because, while RaceFuzzer precisely interleaves the scheduling at the
kernel's instruction level when finding this bug, C repro cannot fully
utilize such a feature. Please disregard all code related to
"should_hypercall" in the C repro, as this is only for our debugging
purposes using our own hypervisor.
