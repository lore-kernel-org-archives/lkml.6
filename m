Good question.  For how many years (or is it decades, now) has Fedora
auto-mounted USB sticks?  :-) Let me know when you successfully get
Fedora to turn of a feature which appears to have great user appeal.

And I'll note that Eric Beiderman just posted a patch series allowing
unprivileged processes to mount file systems in containers.

And remember the mantra which the containner people keep chanting.
Containers are just as secure as VM's.   Hahahaha.....

FUSE is a pretty terrible security boundary.  And not all file systems
have FUSE support.  As I had suggested earlier, probably better to use
9P, and mount the file system in a VM.

I disagree here.  I think it's worth it to disambiguate the two.  If
you have physical access to the machine, you can also apply AC mains
voltage to the USB port, which will likely cause the system to crash.
And at least for Chrome OS, it reboots really quickly.  :-)

If someone can gain control of the system so they can exfiltrate data,
or be able to modify files owned as root, that's a much bigger deal
that crashing the machcine in my view.
