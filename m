Comparing what other file systems print to dmesg at mount time is 
interesting - just tried it for  four file systems, two log nothing by 
default, two log something. See below.


BTRFS:

root@smf-Thinkpad-P51:~/# mount /btrfs
root@smf-Thinkpad-P51:~/c# dmesg
[96283.701117] BTRFS info (device mmcblk0p1): disk space caching is enabled
[96283.701121] BTRFS info (device mmcblk0p1): has skinny extents
[96283.708477] BTRFS info (device mmcblk0p1): enabling ssd optimizations


EXT4:

root@smf-Thinkpad-P51:~# mount /dev/nvme0n1p6 /ext4
root@smf-Thinkpad-P51:~# dmesg
[96654.422038] EXT4-fs (nvme0n1p6): mounted filesystem with ordered data 
mode. Opts: (null)


VFAT:

root@smf-Thinkpad-P51:~# mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /fat
root@smf-Thinkpad-P51:~# dmesg
root@smf-Thinkpad-P51:~#


NFS (it logs messages first time the module is loaded, for the 
id_resolver, but not for the mount):

root@smf-Thinkpad-P51:~# mount -t nfs localhost:/nfsexport /nfs
root@smf-Thinkpad-P51:~# dmesg
root@smf-Thinkpad-P51:~#
