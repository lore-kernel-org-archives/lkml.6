I'm not sure why you would need a feature bit. The capability is
controlled via PCI configuration space. If it is present the device
has the capability. If it is not then it does not.

Basically if the PCI configuration space is not present then the sysfs
entries will not be spawned and nothing will attempt to use this
function.
