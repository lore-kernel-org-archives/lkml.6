I don't think so - the issue is really that DMA API does not yet handle
the SEV case 100% correctly. I suspect passthrough devices would have
the same issue.

In fact whoever sets IOMMU_PLATFORM is completely unaffected by
Christoph's pet peeve.

Christoph is saying that !IOMMU_PLATFORM devices should hide the
compatibility code in a special per-device DMA API implementation.
Which would be fine especially if we can manage not to introduce a bunch
of indirect calls all over the place and hurt performance.  It's just
that the benefit is unlikely to be big (e.g. we can't also get rid of
the virtio specific memory barriers) so no one was motivated enough to
work on it.
