#PF w/ PFEC_SGX is the only exception that indicates a fault is related
to SGX.  Theoretically we could avoid decoding by using a magic value
for the AEP itself and doing even more magic fixup, but that wouldn't
help for faults that occur on EENTER, which can be generic #GPs due to
loss of EPC on SGX1 systems.

Not that it matters, but we could satisfy the "one instruction"
requirement if the fixup changed RIP to point at an ENCLU for #DBs.
