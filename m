I think that's a pretty convincing argument for a "better" CREATE_VM,
one that would have a clearly defined, structured (and potentially
extensible) argument.

I've quickly hacked the following:

diff --git a/include/uapi/linux/kvm.h b/include/uapi/linux/kvm.h

Other architectures could fill in their own bits if they need to.

Thoughts?
