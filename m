I don't think we've really exhausted the possibilities for a cleaner
fix yet.  I have some ideas and would like to test them myself before
making a fool of myself in public.  Is there any chance one of you
could post a minimal way to reproduce the problem?  I fiddled with the
qemu stuff in
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2018-12/msg02082.html
but it's far from minimal and doesn't include the hot-add parts of the
recipe.  I'm pretty much qemu-illiterate, so any hints would be much
appreciated.
