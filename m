The change results in the following:
'dwmmc_k3 f723e000.dwmmc1: failed to set rate 25000000Hz'
'dwmmc_k3 f723d000.dwmmc0: failed to set rate 25000000Hz'
'dwmmc_k3 f723f000.dwmmc2: failed to set rate 25000000Hz'

and later on:
'dwmmc_k3 f723d000.dwmmc0: failed to set rate 52000000Hz'
'dwmmc_k3 f723d000.dwmmc0: failed to set rate 104000000Hz'

Eventually mmc1 (UHS-1 MicroSD) will settle down after repeated
attempts at setting 25 MHz:
'mmc_host mmc1: Bus speed (slot 0) = 100000000Hz (slot req
100000000Hz, actual 100000000HZ div = 0)'
'mmc1: new ultra high speed SDR50 SDHC card at address 0001'
'mmcblk1: mmc1:0001 GB1QT 29.8 GiB'

Same for mmc2 (SDIO WL1835MOD WiFi):
'mmc_host mmc2: Bus speed (slot 0) = 100000000Hz (slot req 50000000Hz,
actual 50000000HZ div = 1)'
'mmc2: new high speed SDIO card at address 0001'

So mmc1 and mmc2 will initialize eventually. I had not observed this
behavior prior. It appears to fail setting
all devices to an initial rate of 25 MHz. However, the same cannot be
said for mmc0 (eMMC).
Again, I observed being able to set the clock manually through debugfs
to 104MHz(/2) which is successful
and the card becomes stable and will initialize properly.

'echo 104000000 > /sys/kernel/debug/mmc0/clock'
'mmc_host mmc0: Bus speed (slot 0) = 200000000Hz (slot req
104000000Hz, actual 100000000HZ div = 1)'

So it seems to settle down at 50 MHz, but only if set manually. It
does appear CLKDIV is being set accordingly now.
