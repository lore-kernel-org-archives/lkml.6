I'm not sure either. See below.

That's a trade-off (memory vs time). Reading GICR_TYPER is a rare thing
(as for all MMIO), and comparing two addresses is cheap. On the other
hand, adding immutable state to each vcpu seems a bit strange.

What do you mean by that? Is that related to the way we currently map
redistributors?

What I mean is that the current code would be better written as

	if (addr = redist_base + 128K * (nr_vcpus -1) + GICR_TYPER)
		value |= GICR_TYPER_LAST;

rather than considering the vcpu_id of the target redistributor
associated vcpu (which I find crazy complicated). This check is the way
a HW implementation would perform it, not by storing some extra state.
You can easily expand this to multiple rdist banks.

Thanks,
