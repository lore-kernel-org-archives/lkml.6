I did not tag it for stable because I didn't think it was a serious enough
problem, based on this from Documentation/process/stable-kernel-rules.rst:

 - It must fix a problem that causes a build error (but not for things
   marked CONFIG_BROKEN), an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real
   security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.  In short, something
   critical.

I know I'm on the conservative end of the stable-tagging spectrum, so maybe
I could be convinced to add a stable tag.

My impression was that this bug caused annoying messages and annoying
delays of a couple seconds during shutdown and resume.  Is it more serious
than that?
