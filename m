This feels like a bad layering violation to me as well.

How about a slightly bigger hammer:  Can we avoid doing P+A for level
interrupts completely?  I don't think that really makes much sense, and
I think we simply everything if we just come back out and resample the
line.  For an edge, something like a network card, there's a potential
performance win to appending a new pending state, but I doubt that this
is the case for level interrupts.

The timer would be unaffected, because it's a HW interrupt.
