So we do have a udev rules in our distro which sets the IO scheduler based
on device parameters (rotational at least, with blk-mq we might start
considering number of queues as well, plus we have some exceptions like
virtio, loop, etc.). So the kernel default doesn't concern us too much as a
distro.

I personally would consider bfq a safer default for single-queue devices
(loop probably needs exception) but I don't feel too strongly about it.
