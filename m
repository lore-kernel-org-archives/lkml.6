Yes, it works for me without _CCIE.

Ok. I was more concerned about an unsolicited event triggering the _isr
while we are modifying the ctrl->slot_ctrl. But that's ok I think as the _isr
reads the hw status anyway.

I think the read part is in wait_event_timeout() which evaluates the condition.
The wake_up is called from the pciehp_isr().  Since the flag is being updated
in both process level and interrupt handler context, smp_mb() is used. I think
the same now applies to  ctrl->slot_ctrl now as this being used in process
context and interrupt context as well.

Thanks,
