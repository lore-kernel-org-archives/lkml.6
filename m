Apologies, thanks for the correction.

I see Stephen Rothwell's message from October 5.  I think at the time I
said "OK, looks minor, just something to mention in the pull request",
then forgot about it.

In future when that happens, I'll add some kind of reminder to my
request-pull script.

Stephen also sent a warning about a merge conflict with the vfs tree
(not merged yet, I think) but I assume that's not as big a deal since it
should actually show up at merge time, not build time:
