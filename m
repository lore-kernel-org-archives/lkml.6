Unfortunately, that's not always the case.

A number of GICv3/v4 implementations (a very common interrupt controller
on ARM servers) cannot be disabled, which means they will keep writing
to their pending tables long after kexec will have started the new
kernel. And since we don't track memory allocation across kexec, you
end-up with significant chances of observing single bit corruption as
interrupts carry on being delivered. Oh, and you won't actually be able
to take MSIs because you can't even reprogram the damn thing.

Yes, this can be considered a HW bug.

See above. Although you can shut off the end-point and to some extent
mask interrupts before jumping into the payload, it is not always
possible to go back to a reasonable state where you can take actually MSIs.
