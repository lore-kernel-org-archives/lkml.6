Nothing right now, it gets installed even though the syscall gets
-ENOSYS. So not ideal, but that's why I was thinking we needed some
form of delete support. But,

socketpair() is a good point. In particular, if we use this queuing
thing I've done above, then you can only ever send one fd, and you'll
need to send two here. So perhaps we really do need to do this as soon
as the tracer calls ioctl(), vs queuing and waiting.

...then if we're going to allow overwriting fds, we'd need to lift out
the logic from do_dup2 somewhere? Is this getting too complicated? :)
