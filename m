No problem, was able to pull it!

I really like this formal description of of the Linux kernel memory coherency 
model and the extensive documentation around it. Clearly a lot of effort went
into this work!

A couple of questions:

- Would it be possible to include all the nice descriptions of the litmus tests in
  the tests themselves? Right now it's a bit weird that most of them come with
  zero explanations, but the tools/memory-model/litmus-tests/README lists most of
  them.

- Similary, some of the high level descriptions in tools/memory-model/README
  should probably propagated into the source code files as well: for example
  both tools/memory-model/lock.cat and linux-kernel.cat could be improved that
  way.

- Could tools/memory-model/MAINTAINERS be added to the main Linux MAINTAINERS file 
  as well, like we do for other bits of tooling?

- There's no description about why the .bell file is called 'bell' and what 
  language/syntax it is in - I had to search around to figure out that it's a 
  "Bell extension" to .cat files. This aspect IMHO isn't really obvious to first 
  time readers so a bit more explanation would be nice.

- A high level question: have you considered calling it the "Linux kernel memory 
  coherency model", instead of the "Linux memory model"? Another naming would be 
  the "Linux kernel memory access model" as memory-barriers.txt calls it.
  The "memory model" name is overly generic, ambiguous and somewhat misleading,
  as we usually mean the virtual memory layout/model when we say "memory model".
  GCC too uses it in that sense: 'small memory model' and 'large memory model' -
  which too is about VM layout, not multiprocessing coherency.

- A long term question: have you considered and would it make sense to generate a
  memory-barriers.txt like file directly into Documentation/locking/, using the
  formal description? That way any changes/extensions/fixes to the model could be
  tracked on a high level, without readers having to understand the formal
  representation.

In any case, the base commit is certainly nice and clean and I've pulled it into 
tip:locking/core for a v4.17 merge.

I believe these additional improvements (to the extent you agree with doing them!) 
could/should be done as add-on commits on top of this existing commit.

Thanks,

	Ingo
