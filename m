From both aac_fib_vector_assign() and aac_src_deliver_message(), looks
every msix vector is used inside driver, so causes this trouble.

From 84676c1f21e8ff54b (genirq/affinity: assign vectors to all possible CPUs),
actually it should have been since 9a0ef98e18 (genirq/affinity: Assign vectors
to all present CPUs), it isn't guaranteed that one vector can be mapped to
at least one online CPU.

So it should be fixed in driver by similar approach taken in the
following patches:
	scsi: hpsa: fix selection of reply queue
	scsi: megaraid_sas: fix selection of reply queue

And the reason this issue won't be observed is that the following
patches(merged to v4.17) may avoid this issue, but in theory, the issue
won't be avoided completely by these patches:

d3056812e7df genirq/affinity: Spread irq vectors among present CPUs as far as possible
1a2d0914e23a genirq/affinity: Allow irq spreading from a given starting point
b3e6aaa8d94d genirq/affinity: Move actual irq vector spreading into a helper function
47778f33dcba genirq/affinity: Rename *node_to_possible_cpumask as *node_to_cpumask
0211e12dd0a5 genirq/affinity: Don't return with empty affinity masks on error

In short, this issue should have been fixed in upstream aacraid, and the idea
is simple, use the current CPU id to retrieve the msix vector offset, this
way will make sure that the msix vector can be mapped from one online
CPU.

Thanks,
Ming
