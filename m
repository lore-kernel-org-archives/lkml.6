I read the cover letter and still don´t know what this is about. Now I 
am certainly not engaged deeply with LSM. I bet my main missing piece 
is: What is a "blob sharing" LSM.

I think it would improve the cover letter greatly if it explains briefly 
what is a major LSM, what is a minor LSM and what is a "blob sharing" 
LSM.

Why those are all needed? What is the actual security or end user 
benefit of this work? The questions are not to question your work. I bet 
it makes all perfect sense. I just did not understand its sense from 
reading the cover letter.
