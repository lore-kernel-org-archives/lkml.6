This will make it easier to track and easier to understand
what components and features are part of the FW_LOADER. There
are some components related to firmware which have *nothing* to
do with the FW_LOADER, souch as PREVENT_FIRMWARE_BUILD.

-	  Device drivers which require firmware can typically deal with

-	  kernel firmware files. Built-in firmware searches are preceded

-	  /lib/firmware paths documented on CONFIG_FW_LOADER.
-
-	  This may be useful for testing or if the firmware is required early on
-	  in boot and cannot rely on the firmware being placed in an initrd or
-	  initramfs.
-
-	  This option is a string and takes the (space-separated) names of the
-	  firmware files -- the same names that appear in MODULE_FIRMWARE()
-	  and request_firmware() in the source. These files should exist under
-	  the directory specified by the EXTRA_FIRMWARE_DIR option, which is
-	  /lib/firmware by default.
-
-	  For example, you might set CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE="usb8388.bin", copy
-	  the usb8388.bin file into /lib/firmware, and build the kernel. Then
-	  any request_firmware("usb8388.bin") will be satisfied internally
-	  inside the kernel without ever looking at your filesystem at runtime.
-
-	  WARNING: If you include additional firmware files into your binary

-	  firmware failed using the different /lib/firmware/ paths, or the
-	  path specified in the firmware_class path module parameter, or the
-	  firmware_class path kernel boot parameter if the firmware_class is

-	  If the custom fallback mechanism is used userspace must always
-	  acknowledge failure to find firmware as the timeout for the fallback
-	  mechanism is disabled, and failed requests will linger forever.
-
-	  This used to be the default firmware loading facility, and udev used
-	  to listen for uvents to load firmware for the kernel. The firmware
-	  loading facility functionality in udev has been removed, as such it
-	  can no longer be relied upon as a fallback mechanism. Linux no longer

-
-	  Since this was the default firmware loading facility at one point,

-	  mechanism can never be removed from the kernel.
-
-	  You should only enable this functionality if you are certain you
-	  require a fallback mechanism and have a userspace mechanism ready to
-	  load firmware in case it is not found. One main reason for this may
-	  be if you have drivers which require firmware built-in and for
-	  whatever reason cannot place the required firmware in initramfs.
-	  Another reason kernels may have this feature enabled is to support a
-	  driver which explicitly relies on this fallback mechanism. Only two
-	  drivers need this today:
-
-	    o CONFIG_LEDS_LP55XX_COMMON
-	    o CONFIG_DELL_RBU
-
-	  Outside of supporting the above drivers, another reason for needing
-	  this may be that your firmware resides outside of the paths the kernel
-	  looks for and cannot possibly be specified using the firmware_class
-	  path module parameter or kernel firmware_class path boot parameter
-	  if firmware_class is built-in.
-
-	  A modern use case may be to temporarily mount a custom partition
