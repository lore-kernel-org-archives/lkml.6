I disagree with your cynicism but v2 of this patch now emits a warning
accordingly.

You rejected the idea of allowing fine-grained control over whether
native NVMe multipathing is enabled or not on a per-namespace basis.
All we have is the coarse-grained nvme_core.multipath=N knob.  Now
you're forecasting removing even that.  Please don't do that.

It has wasted _way_ too much time.

But the drama is born out of you rejecting that we need to preserve
multipath-tools and dm-multipath's ability to work across any
transport.  You don't need to do that work: Hannes, myself and others
have always been willing and able -- if you'd let us.

IIRC it was at 2016's LSF in Boston where Ewan Milne and I had a
face-to-face conversation with you in the hallway track where you agreed
that ANA support would be activated if the capability was advertised by
the target.  The model we discussed is that it would be comparable to
how ALUA gets enabled during SCSI LUN discovery.

I hope you can see your way forward to be more accommodating now.
Especially given the proposed changes are backed by NVMe standards.

Please, PLEASE take v2 of this patch.. please? ;)

Thanks,
Mike
