Yeah, it's not super pricey, but it's not needed. BFQ is the user of
the members, and the one that assigns them. You're saying leftover
assignments, since it doesn't always assign them. Hence I think that's
a better fix, just sent out a test patch a few minutes ago.

You did all the hard work, I'm just coasting on your findings.
