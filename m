Isolated with CPUs overlapping some other cpuset makes little sense, I
agree. What I have in mind however is an isolated set of CPUs that don't
overlap with any other cpuset (as your balanced set above). In this case
I think it makes sense to let the sys admin decide if "automatic" load
balancing has to be performed (by the scheduler) or no load balacing at
all has to take place?

Further extending your example:

             Root [0-3]
	     /        \
        group1 [0-1] group2[2-3]

Why should we prevent load balancing to be disabled at root level (so
that for example tasks still residing in root group are not freely
migrated around, potentially disturbing both sub-groups)?

Then one can decide that group1 is a "userspace managed" group (no load
balancing takes place) and group2 is balanced by the scheduler.

And this is not DEADLINE specific, IMHO.

I checked again myself (sched domains code is always a maze :) and I
believe that sched_load_balance flag indeed controls domains (sched and
root) creation and configuration . Changing the flag triggers potential
rebuild and separed sched/root domains are generated if subgroups have
non overlapping cpumasks.  cpu_exclusive only enforces this latter
condition.
