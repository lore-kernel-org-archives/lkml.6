Ok, so I've made a ROM dump of one of the tablets which I have with
the touchscreen firmware embedded in the EFI code using flashrom,
then I ran UEFIExtract on it, to get all the separate files.

Then I wrote a little test.sh script using hexdump piped to grep to
find the magic prefix, here is the result of running this on all
files UEFIExtract generated:

[hans@shalem chuwi-vi8-plus-cwi519-bios.bin.dump]$ find -type f -exec ./test.sh '{}' \;
0x00000c40        3136    B0 07 00 00 E4 07 00 00
found in ./2 BIOS region/6 8C8CE578-8A3D-4F1C-9935-896185C32DD3/31 I2cHid/1 EE4E5898-3914-4259-9D6E-DC7BD79403CF/0 PE32 image section/body.bin
0x00000be0        3040    B0 07 00 00 E4 07 00 00
found in ./2 BIOS region/5 8C8CE578-8A3D-4F1C-9935-896185C32DD3/31 I2cHid/1 EE4E5898-3914-4259-9D6E-DC7BD79403CF/0 PE32 image section/body.bin

With the version found at offset 0xbe0 of the "5 8C8CE578-8A3D-4F1C-9935-896185C32DD3"
section matching what we find in the efi_boot_services_code while running.

As the I2cHid name suggests this is embedded in the driver (which is a PE executable), not in a separate file:
[hans@shalem chuwi-vi8-plus-cwi519-bios.bin.dump]$ file './2 BIOS region/5 8C8CE578-8A3D-4F1C-9935-896185C32DD3/31 I2cHid/1 EE4E5898-3914-4259-9D6E-DC7BD79403CF/0 PE32 image section/body.bin'
./2 BIOS region/5 8C8CE578-8A3D-4F1C-9935-896185C32DD3/31 I2cHid/1 EE4E5898-3914-4259-9D6E-DC7BD79403CF/0 PE32 image section/body.bin: MS-DOS executable

So using the EFI_FIRMWARE_VOLUME_PROTOCOL.ReadFile() is not really
going to help here, since this is not in a separate file which we
can consume in its entirety, we still need to scan for the prefix
and do e.g. a CRC check to make sure we've actually got what we
expect, at which point simply scanning all of efi_boot_services_code
is a lot simpler and less error prone.

Using an implementation specific EFI protocol for this means calling
into EFI code and potentially triggering various bugs in there, breaking
boot. This is esp. likely to happen since this is a protocol which is
not used outside of the EFI ROMs internal code so there are likely
little ABI guarantees making this approach extra error prone.

Just scanning the efi_boot_services_code OTOH is quite safe TODO.

As for the overhead of scanning the efi_boot_services_code, we are
only doing this on a dmi match, so on most machines there is no
overhead other then the dmi check. On machines where there is
a dmi match, the price (I guess about 30 ms or so for the scan)
is well worth the result of having the touchscreen OOTB.

Regard,

Hans
