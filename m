Sure, but I am talking about the VM's 'virtual port'.

Sure.

This is wrong too, in Linux the WC's for GMP packets include the pkey
index that was used to RX the packet. This is a Linux extension
matching the one on the sending side.

The hypervisor *must* block these GMPs, it is a hard requirement of
the pkey security model for VMs.

AFAIK the Mellanox drivers do this right - do you know differently?

Again, this is wrong, the BTH.Pkey and REQ.Pkey should be the same -
please fix that first before trying to change anything else.

If BTH.Pkey != REQ.PKey then the requestor side has to obviously
select two PKeys, which is basically impossible.

The VM should not be part of the default partition, for instance.

It might not help you, but is shows this fix for the pkey trap issue
is wrong. You must fix the pkey traps on the sending side, not on the
responder side..

Upstream kernel (eg 4.16) and newish Mellanox firmware please.

And it would be fantastic if you could ID why this is happening, AFAIK
it should be OK in the kernel.
