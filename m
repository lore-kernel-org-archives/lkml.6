I am really slow at following up this discussion. The problem I would
see with off-lru pages is that this can quickly turn into a weird
reclaim behavior. Especially when we are talking about a lot of memory.
It is true that such pages wouldn't be reclaimable directly but could
poke them in some way if we see too many of them while scanning LRU.

Not that this is a fundamental block stopper but this is the first thing
that popped out when thinking about such a solution. Maybe it is a good
start though.

Appart from that, do we really care about 32b here? Big DIO, IB users
seem to be 64b only AFAIU.
