I'll try to find some time to check that this doesn't break 8916 and
8974...again...

If you just use writel() instead of writel_relaxed() you don't need to
sprinkle the driver with comments like this. And you really should be
able to just say "Ensure ordering between core_mem and hc_mem writes" if
you really feel like making it explicit.

Please split this up in read, modify and write operations.

That's not what "mb()" does, it ensures that any writes that was done
before this line will hit the hardware before any writes that is done
after this line.

But again, using writel() would save us from doing this explicitly
throughout the code.

Please rewrite as 3 operations.

Do we need to set the pwr switch value as well? Or we're fine relying on
the existing value here?
