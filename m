Well, it's 100% reproducable on a particular model of system
(garrison) with a particular model of card.  I've had some suggestions
that it fails with some other systems card card models, but nothing
confirmed - the one other system model I've been able to try, which
also had a newer card model didn't reproduce the problem.

Possibly.  On the other hand, I've had it reported that this is a
software regression at least with downstream red hat kernels.  I
haven't yet been able to eliminate factors that might be confusing
that, or try to find a working version upstream.
