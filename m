Right, just exposing (or not) a property (which will become a libvirt
capability) should work for the management layers to determine if a
migration will fail, and then not attempt it. We just tend to avoid
allowing new properties from appearing in old machine types, and thus
new machine types would be the only ones exposing it. I'm not sure if
we need to be so strict though.

Capabilities can certainly be added for anything that need them, including
a new sysreg. QEMU just currently manages the sysregs as an array,
without concern for which ones are old and which ones are new. Of course
that can be changed. It may not even be that difficult to do, we just
need to filter registers before adding the array to the migration
stream.

I agree. Without planning to wait for the userspace changes, then I
guess we don't need to wait for a decision on how to do them yet either.
