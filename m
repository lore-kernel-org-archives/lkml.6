Thomas, what is wrong with *you*?  This is completely unnecessary.

First of all, I sent Baolin on this approach, as I was getting sick of
seeing the suspend/resume timing continually adding extra warts and
complexity to handle odd hardware that needs some solution. So I
suggested he clean that up in a way that lets these multiple ways of
solving the problem be done in device specific code w/o adding more
complexity to the core logic - in a fashion how the clocksources
allowed us to support nice fast/well-behaving hardware w/o preventing
ugly-but-neccessary solutions like the pit clocksource.

Now, I've also been quite a poor maintainer of late, and haven't done
much to help with pre-review of Baloin's code.  So that's on me, not
him.

Admittedly, my taste isn't always great, so there is likely to be a
better approach, and having your guidance here is *really* valued. I
just wish we could get it without all this unnecessary vinegar.

I was really lucky to have your guidance and support when I was
starting in the community. Your helping bring me up as a co-maintainer
(only a a relatively small set of responsibility compared to your much
wider maintainership), does let me see that having the responsibility
of billions of devices running your code is immense and comes with no
small amount of stress. Juggling the infinite incoming stream of
review requests on naieve or otherwise lacking code with other
important development priorities is a major burden, so *I really get
how frustrating it is*.

And its super annoying to have lots of short-term development requests
being thrown at you when you're the one who has to maintain it for the
long term.  But long-long-term, no one is going to be a maintainer
forever, and we are not going to develop more olympic swimmers if we
keep peeing in the pool.


Baolin: My apologies for leading you poorly here. Work on something
else for a day to let the flames burn off you, then review Thomas'
technical feedback, ignoring the harsh style, and try to address his
technical comments with the approach. I'll try to do better in finding
time to review your work.
