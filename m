This had crossed my mind when I first looked at the code.
DPC is getting triggered for both ERR_NONFATAL and ERR_FATAL case.
I thought the primary purpose of DPC to recover fatal errors, by 
triggering HW recovery.
but what if some platform wants to handle both FATAL and NON_FATAL with 
DPC ?

As you said AER FATAL cases and DPC FATAL cases should be handled 
similarly.
e.g. remove/re-enumerate the devices.

while NON_FATAL case; only AER would come into picture.
if some platform would like to handle DPC NON_FATAL then it should 
follow AER NON_FATAL path  (where it does not do remove/re-enumerate)

And the case where hotplug is enabled, remove/re-enumerate more sense in 
case of ERR_FATAL.
And the case where hotplug is disabled, only re-enumeration is required. 
(no need to remove the devices)
but then do we need to handle this case specifically, what is the harm 
in removing the devices in all the cases followed by re-enumerate ?
