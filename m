Yeah, so I think what should be done instead is to write a script that refreshes 
all the arch-support.txt files in-place.

(And no, I'd not add checkpatch support.)

It's OK for the script to have various quirks for weirdly implemented features and 
exceptions: i.e. basically whenever it gets a feature wrong, we can just tweak the 
script with quirks to make it all work out of box.
 
New features can then be added by basically just creating a header-only 
arch-support.txt file, such as:

  triton:~/tip/Documentation/features> cat foo/bar/arch-support.txt
  #
  # Feature name:          shiny new fubar kernel feature
  #         Kconfig:       ARCH_USE_FUBAR
  #         description:   arch supports the fubar feature
  #

And running Documentation/features/scripts/features-refresh.sh would auto-generate 
the arch support matrix.

Minimal changes to the existing arch-support.txt headers to make them more 
script-friendly would be OK as well I suppose, for example 
locking/rwsem-optimized/arch-support.txt right now has this:

  #         Kconfig:       Optimized asm/rwsem.h

A real Kconfig value could be used here - or even introduced, to make this all 
easier to support. I.e. it's OK to harmonize feature support within the kernel to 
make everything more clearly organized.

But in the end there should only be a single new script:

  Documentation/features/scripts/features-refresh.sh

... which operates on the arch-support.txt files and refreshes them in place, and 
which, after all the refreshes have been committed, should produce an empty
'git diff' result.

This way we soft- decouple the refreshing of the entries from the introduction of 
the features, while still making it all easy to keep sync and to extend.

I don't have the time to implement this feature myself, but if you'd like to try 
such an approach yourself, I can help merge the result upstream via the -tip tree.

Thanks,

	Ingo
