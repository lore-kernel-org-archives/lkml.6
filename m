[+to Rafal]

Sorry, I'm an idiot and forgot to include Rafal, the submitter, when I
forwarded this report to the mailing lists.

I suspect that the config accessors used by lspci should temporarily
wake up devices that are asleep, instead of reporting 0xff data (or if
that's not feasible, maybe we should add a comment in the kernel and a
note in the lspci man page).

I'm not sure yet where to go beyond that.
