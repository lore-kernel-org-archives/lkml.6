Fair enough, but then I could not make that change without the mmc
maintainer agreeing with it.

Again, everyone wants to be first, saving 100ms is great, but make sure
this will not break anything else.  It's a huge change to a
long-standing "we know this works" linker order.  Personally, I would
not want to accept this patch for that reason alone.

Also given you ignored the comment for the tty line doesn't make me feel
comfortable either.

If you really really need this, I would suggest just doing it in your
device-specific tree for a few years and when this is the only
out-of-tree patch you are carrying, then revisit it :)
