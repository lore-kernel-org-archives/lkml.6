One of the three significant concerns brought up about the cgroup aware
oom killer is that its decisionmaking is completely evaded by creating
subcontainers and attaching processes such that the ancestor's usage does
not exceed another cgroup on the system.

Consider the example from the previous patch where "memory" is set in
each mem cgroup's cgroup.controllers:

	mem cgroup	cgroup.procs
	==========	============
	/cg1		1 process consuming 250MB
	/cg2		3 processes consuming 100MB each
	/cg3/cg31	2 processes consuming 100MB each
	/cg3/cg32	2 processes consuming 100MB each

If memory.oom_policy is "cgroup", a process from /cg2 is chosen because it
is in the single indivisible memory consumer with the greatest usage.

The true usage of /cg3 is actually 400MB, but a process from /cg2 is
chosen because cgroups are compared individually rather than
hierarchically.

If a system is divided into two users, for example:

	mem cgroup	memory.max
	==========	==========
	/userA		250MB
	/userB		250MB

If /userA runs all processes attached to the local mem cgroup, whereas
/userB distributes their processes over a set of subcontainers under
/userB, /userA will be unfairly penalized.

There is incentive with cgroup v2 to distribute processes over a set of
subcontainers if those processes shall be constrained by other cgroup
controllers; this is a direct result of mandating a single, unified
hierarchy for cgroups.  A user may also reasonably do this for mem cgroup
control or statistics.  And, a user may do this to evade the cgroup-aware
oom killer selection logic.

This patch adds an oom policy, "tree", that accounts for hierarchical
usage when comparing cgroups and the cgroup aware oom killer is enabled by
an ancestor.  This allows administrators, for example, to require users in
their own top-level mem cgroup subtree to be accounted for with
hierarchical usage.  In other words, they can longer evade the oom killer
by using other controllers or subcontainers.

If an oom policy of "tree" is in place for a subtree, such as /cg3 above,
the hierarchical usage is used for comparisons with other cgroups if
either "cgroup" or "tree" is the oom policy of the oom mem cgroup.  Thus,
if /cg3/memory.oom_policy is "tree", one of the processes from /cg3's
subcontainers is chosen for oom kill.
