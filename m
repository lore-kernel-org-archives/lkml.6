Hi Dave, Darrick,

It's not that we don't want to make the system more useful, it's just
that we don't see what reasonably can be done here. The system does
not have notion of images, sound files, USB devices. It feeds data
into system calls, and that's what it provides as reproducers. Also
see the last paragraph.

Please elaborate re commits. It's a basic rule of any good bug report
-- communicate exact state of source code when the bug was hit, i.e.
provide the commit hash.

This is quite subjective and we hear opinions all possible ways. I
don't think there is one size fits all. E.g. +Ted argued in exactly
the opposite direction: make reports more laconic, formal,
table-formatted with dry information. There is also a tradeoff between
describing each detail in proper, friendly English and being more
laconic. If we increase everything 4x and post a wall of text with
each report, lots of people won't read anything of it just because
it's a wall of text. I am also not a native English speaker, so
providing simple formal text is a safer option than writing something
potentially clumsy.

Having said that, I am collecting proposals for report format
improvements. Here is fortunately slightly better wording for footer
based on your idea:

Well, I guess nobody has infinite engineering resources. If we would
have them we would also fix all these bug ourselves and don't bother
you at all. Just as any other company could invest in writing bug
detection tools, fuzzers, deploy them and report bugs, which would
relief us from this.
We have limited resources and do what's possible within these
resources. Unfortunately providing individual handling of each of the
thousands of bugs is not possible within these resources. I know that
what we are doing is useful for kernel overall because lots of
hundreds of bugs get fixed due to this effort. If you, as xfs
maintainers, think that these reports are net negative for xfs and xfs
should not be tested, say so and we will figure out how to make it
happen.

Thanks
