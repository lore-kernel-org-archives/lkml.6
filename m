Correct, you would set those callback on the mmap of your doorbell.

Yes simple helper that implement a sane default implementation is
definitly a good idea. As i was working with GPU it was not something
that immediatly poped to mind (see below). But i can certainly do
a sane set of default helper that simple device driver can use right
away without too much thinking on there part. I will add this for
next posting.

> Do any drivers need more control than this?

GPU driver do want more control :) GPU driver are moving things around
all the time and they have more memory than bar space (on newer platform
AMD GPU do resize the bar but it is not the rule for all GPUs). So
GPU driver do actualy manage their BAR address space and they map and
unmap thing there. They can not allow someone to just pin stuff there
randomly or this would disrupt their regular work flow. Hence they need
control and they might implement threshold for instance if they have
more than N pages of bar space map for peer to peer then they can decide
to fall back to main memory for any new peer mapping.
