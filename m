Ok, so ... yes, I'm really interested in basic support. But drivers

Well, I don't think object file size is huge problem. First,
"distribution" kernel with support for 6 different chips will be ~71k,
while your proposal will result in ~136k. Second, yes, we could put
ifdefs into ti-lmu data file to make it smaller.

Anyway, clean source code and easy maintainance is more important.

I believe there's quite a lot of code that could be shared.=20

Well, you may know that hardware better than I do. But if you generate

Tony Lindgren asked me to get support merged, and that's what I'm
trying to do. I have Milo's sign off, that means he is/was ok with
upstreaming that code; no, I did not have reason to contact him.

Well, the devices seem to have quite a lot in common. Yes, single
driver for all of them will be somehow complex; but I believe that's
still better than copy&pasting code.

Anyway, I showed my proposal. I need support for ti,lm3532, but I can
get basic support for many other chips with very little code.

Do you plan basic support for support other chips in near future? Is
TI willing to maintain the LED drivers?

What is your proposal for lm3532 support? Should I just cp lm3697
lm3532, then adjust register map? (Will not that cause rather ugly
code duplication?)

Best regards,
