Interesting. Mimi you may want to look into that for appraisal gap coverage.

This and other reasons have been scattered through mailing lists, and
documentation, our Kconfig does not reflect which of the reasons are
currently addressed as how. Our goal for your commit log would be to
document the precise reason you can't use any of the existing interfaces
exposed. Let's see if some of the reasons you state cannot be used
with the existing APIs.

In such cases the firmware may be stashed in a separate partition of a custom
device and firmwared could be used with a uevent and the fallback mechanism,
enabling userspace to do whatever it needs.

However in your case the firmware has been found on EFI.

Indeed, we don't have a good way to deal with this now except the above
noted firmwared use case, and that still ponies up the redistribution problem
up to a system integrator somehow.

But also -- your solution is super custom to only two drivers, does not
follow a standard of any sort either, and I fear of setting any wrong
precedents which will be hard to later not support.

Just look at the fallback mechanism and how hairy it got, I've put some
love into it recently but it was a pain to even comprehend. Once we add
this interface we are going to have to support it for a while so I want
to be sure we get the architecture right. Specially if were going to enable
*other* vendors to start using such interface.

Is your goal to enable or encourage other vendors in similar predicament to
use the same strategy?

There is nothing wrong in setting de-facto standards for Linux, we do this
all the time, but if we are going to do it I want to be sure we document
this well and provide proper justifications in the commit log and
documentation.

Please specify this is through a custom scheme.... as it reads now it seems
to read this is a sort of standard.

This is a new fallback mechanism, please see:

Documentation/driver-api/firmware/fallback-mechanisms.rst

Refer to the section "Types of fallback mechanisms", augument the list there
and then move the section "Firmware sysfs loading facility" to a new file, and
then add a new file for your own.

You in no way indicate this is a just an invented scheme, a custom solution and
nothing standard.  I realize Ard criticized that the EFI Firmware Volume Protocol
is not part of the UEFI spec -- however it is a bit more widely used right?
Why can't Linux support it instead?

Could your new scheme grow to support the EFI Firmware Volume Protocol rather
easily if someone wants to wrap up their sleeves? If so what likely would change?

Ensure that the documentation answers the question then, when would folks
use the EFI Firmware Volume Protocol? Why can't Linux support it? Why and would
use this alternative scheme?

Granted, we seem to have reverse engineered it, but we can certainly improve
upon it, and if we're going to make a new de-facto standard for Linux best
we cover our bases for our justifications.

Well we should also only enable this for systems that enable these drivers
*and* enable this kernel feature. Ie, if the drivers are enabled but
the feature is disabled nothing new should happen.

I'd like this feature disabled by default for now.

This sounds funny, best to just start off describing that this is just a new
fallback mechanism.

Mention that this is for struct platform_device's and what you'd use is
PROPERTY_ENTRY_BOOL(). Provide an example.

Anyway, I'm in no way a fan of this being the only requirement. It makes
no sense to call into EFI or check a device property if the driver didn't
even  mean it to happen.

As I have been asking for a while now, please also add a new
firmware_request_efi() which if called would enable a new internal
firmware_loader flag FW_OPT_EFI which you'd kdoc'ify and add to
drivers/base/firmware_loader/firmware.h.
Then only if *this* internal flag is set would we call fw_get_efi_embedded_fw()
(I'm also asking you to rename this to firmware_fallback_efi() below).

You'll need both the device property and for the driver to use this new
firmware_request_efi() call.

Please add a CONFIG_FW_LOADER_FALLBACK_EFI which will be properly
documented on a Kconfig which then if selected would select
CONFIG_EFI_EMBEDDED_FIRMWARE which enables the efi_check_for_embedded_firmwares().
Note you'd be expanding CONFIG_FW_LOADER_FALLBACK_EFI with the new call too.

Please rename to firmware_fallback_efi() and kdocify it above. I'll soon post a
patch which does the same for firmware_fallback_sysfs(). Andres's
pending patch renames fw_sysfs_fallback() to firmware_sysfs_fallback()
but in retrospect it should be firmware_fallback_sysfs() -- I'll fix this.

This is going to get complex. If you can come up with a nicer scheme for dealing
with fallback that'd be appreciated. If you this is the most legible you can
come up with I understand though, I can have a look later.
