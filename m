That's my point, current test module is not robust, I wanted to ask if
there is a way to fix it that does not depend on arch features, because
if there is a dependency that is not met we are still not fixing the
current code, using it as a fallback can still create issues.

If you have a simple reproducer for the bugs I am happy to help you test
it (I can also apply arm64 DYNAMIC_FTRACE_WITH_REGS patches and test that
new code path if that's the final direction we are taking).

Thanks,
Lorenzo
