I already thought about providing a sysfs interface for all that instead
of using ioctls. But as I am pretty new to kernel programming I do not
have all the required insight. Especially, as writing the mbr requires
the sed-opal password I am unsure how a clean sysfs interface to provide
the password together with a simple dd would look like.
Moreover I already have a patch that changes the 'void *data' argument
to setup_opal_dev to a kobject pointer. As far as I know, this is the
first step to get into the sysfs hierarchy. But as I do not have access
to an NVMe drive and have no idea about its implementation, this change
works only for the scsi side.
In other words, if someone could hint me in the right direction, I would
be glad to (re)implement the ioctl interface for sysfs. Moreover, this
would allow to export some additional information like the current state
of the device (is it looke, is sed-opal enabled, whats the current state
of mbr, etc.).
