Putting metadata in user files beyond EOF doesn't work with XFS's
post-EOF speculative allocation algorithms.

i.e. Filesystem design/algorithms often assume that the region
beyond EOF in user files is a write-only region.  e.g. We can allow
extents beyond EOF to be uninitialised because they are in a write
only region of the file and so there's no possibility of stale data
exposure. Unfortunately, putting filesystem/security metadata beyond
EOF breaks these assumptions - it's no longer a write-only region.

IOWs, all these existing assumptions and implementation details are
exposed to a new attack surface involving tricking the filesystem
into thinking it has readable data beyond EOF. And because it can
now read from the "write only" region beyond EOF (because that's the
mechanism by which fsverity does it's verification) we no longer
have a clear line of protection against exposing such data to
userspace.

Putting the merkel tree somewhere else in the filesystem metadata
and providing a separate API to manipulate it avoids this problem.
It allows filesystems to keep their internal metadata and
security-related verification information in a separate channel (and
trust path) that is completely out of user data/access scope.

Cheers,

Dave.
