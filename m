That is the logical outcome of what you are asking for.  There will
*always* be a point after which where we can't atomically unwind the
mount, and we have to proceed.  And after that point, when we detect
an inconsistency all we can do is what the system administrator
requested that we do.  Sure, for this particular case, we can
significantly add more complexity and decrease the maintainability of
the code paths involved.  But there will always be another case
(e.g,. xattr's being read by SELinux or IMA) that will happen during
the mount, and are we expected to catch all of those cases?

We do catch a lot of cases where we refuse the mount and complain that
the file system is badly corrupted.  This just doesn't happen to be
one of them.

These are different because there are kernel OOPS or warning messages.
This is neither a kernel OOPS or a WARN_ON or BUG_ON.

Syzkaller (or anyone else) can mount the file system with
errors=continue or errors=remount-ro if it wants to override the
requested behavior of the flag in the superblock which is manipulated
by tune2fs.
