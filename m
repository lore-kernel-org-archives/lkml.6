Yup, in a nutshell. Even O_DIRECT on DAX doesn't modify the physical
storage directly - it ends up in the pmem driver and it does a
memcpy() to move the data to/from the physical storage and the user
space buffer. It's exactly the same IO path as moving data to/from
the physical storage into the page cache pages....

Cheers,

Dave.
