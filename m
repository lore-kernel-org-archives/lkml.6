Ah, I forgot about the kexec path.  The kexec path is used for
crashdump, too, so ideally the newly-loaded kernel would defend itself
when possible so it doesn't depend on the original kernel doing things
correctly.

Seems like this question of whether to do things in the original
kernel or the kexec-ed kernel comes up periodically, but I can never
remember a definitive answer.  My initial reaction is that it'd be
nice if we didn't have to do *any* shutdown in the original kernel,
but I'm sure there are reasons that's not practical.

I copied Eric (kexec maintainer) and Vivek (contact listed in
Documentation/kdump/kdump.txt) in case they have suggestions or would
consider some sort of Documentation/ update.
