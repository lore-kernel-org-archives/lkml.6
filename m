I think this can be relaxed in a few cases (not just session setup),
but is a good
general rule.  If only the parent function needs to be changed it is
easy decision,
but if changes more than two layers, perhaps not.

We also have to
- log the tid and session id somewhere in human readable form
- perhaps allow an IOCtl to retrieve the UNC name from the tid, and similarly
something human readable for the session id (server and username)
(or add the tid and session id to what is displayed in
/proc/fs/cifs/DebugData so
we can extract it from the DebugData output)
