Yes, I've been thinking about this. There are more branches now
("to dyn or not to dyn") in compression/decompression hot path but
we see less instructions and branches in perf output at the end.
And my guess is that we have a lot of noise from zram and zsmalloc.
The data is XXX bytes shorter with dyn enabled, so we use YYY less
moves and ZZZ less branches while we copy the data to zsmalloc and
from zsmalloc, and I may be that's the root cause of "performance
gain" that we see in zram-fio tests. So may be we need to run
benchmarks against lz4, not zram+lz4.

Great, thanks.
