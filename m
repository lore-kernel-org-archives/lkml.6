To clarify, I assume "native PCI enumeration" means platform firmware
is not involved in hotplug, which means we would use pciehp (not
acpiphp) for these Thunderbolt hotplug events.

Have you observed disruption of existing devices when hot-adding a new
device?  That's a much more serious problem than if the new device
doesn't work.  It will always be possible that we don't have enough
resources for a hot-added device, but it should never break a
previously working device.

If you've seen breakage of an existing device, I'd like to start with
the minimum patch that solves only *that*, with following patches that
improve the likelihood that hot-added devices will work.

It's always good to break up patches into the smallest logical units
(as long as none introduces a regression, i.e., after each patch, the
kernel must build and work as well as before).

That minimum patch may be a candidate for backporting, while the new
functionality (improving support for hot-added devices) may not be.

Do you have a reference for this?  Some background on this would be
really useful in case those restrictions have any bearing on Linux.

You mention two problems with (apparently) two solutions.  If it's
possible to separate these into two (or more) patches, please do that.

Some of this text, especially the previous two paragraphs and the
following text, would better fit in a [0/N] cover letter because it
will not be useful after this work is merged, i.e., it won't be
interesting to people reading the git changelogs.

I/O space is still used by some devices, so we can't drop it
completely.  We can certainly improve Linux behavior when it's
exhausted though.  There are outstanding bugs in that area.
