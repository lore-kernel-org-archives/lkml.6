Hi, Dave

Thank you for kindly help and reply. and sorry for late reply.

Because I just test the patch. It will not work thoroughly.

but I unite the following three patches from upstream, the issue will not occur.

0070ed3 Fix 16-byte memory leak in gssp_accept_sec_context_upcall
78794d1 svcrpc: don't leak contexts on PROC_DESTROY
a1d1e9b svcrpc: fix memory leak in gssp_accept_sec_context_upcall

I think we should backport the relevant patches to stable-3.10.

Thanks,
zhong jiang
