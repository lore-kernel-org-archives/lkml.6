I haven't been able to find where in the spec it forbids route to self.
But I was told this by developers who work know switches. Hopefully
Stephen can find the reference.

But it's a bit of a moot point. Devices can DMA to themselves if they
are designed to do so. For example, some NVMe cards can read and write
their own CMB for certain types of DMA request. There is a register in
the spec (CMBSZ) which specifies which types of requests are supported.
(See 3.1.12 in NVMe 1.3a).

No, I don't get where you think we need to have two common upstream
bridges. I'm not sure when such a case would ever happen. But you seem
to understand based on what you wrote below.

If you have a multifunction device designed to DMA to itself below a
root port, it can. But determining this is on a device by device basis,
just as determining whether a root complex can do peer to peer is on a
per device basis. So I'd say we don't want to allow it by default and
let someone who has such a device figure out what's necessary if and
when one comes along.

Yes, this is what I meant when I said walking the entire tree. I've been
kicking the can down the road on implementing this as getting ref
counting right and testing it is going to be quite tricky. The single
switch approach we implemented now is just a simplification which works
for a single switch. But I guess we can look at implementing it this way
for v4.
