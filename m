I fear the jargon is mostly unavoidable :(

Yes, the 'control domain' term is a source of much confusion :(

Not removed. What about an explanation like the following somewhere:

"AP instructions identify the domain that is targeted to process the
command: This must be one of the usage domains. They may modify a
domain that is not one of the usage domains, but the modified domain
must be one of the control domains."

I hope that is both correct and understandable ;)

OK, so the guest effectively won't see the domain. That makes sense.

Might be a good idea to add this as an additional example.

What about the following sentence:

"Dynamically modifying the AP matrix for a running guest (which would
amount to hot(un)plug of AP devices for the guest) is currently not
supported."

Most of the approaches to live migration of vfio devices are focused on
pci devices; even ccw devices have different needs. Any halfway generic
approach would need a common part and a backend-specific part anyway, I
think.

From what I have seen of the AP virtualization architecture, this may
very well be the case. I'll keep AP in the back of my head, but it's
probably better to focus on the easier targets first.
