Right, it is working on the presumption that this is how all "indirectio 
IO" hosts and children should/would be described in DSDT.

Nothing apart from only being used by arm64 platforms today, which is 
circumstantial.

I did mention an alternative in my "ping" in v12 patch 7/9 (Feb 1), but 
no response to this specific note so I kept on the same path.

Here's what I then wrote:
"I think another solution - which you may prefer - is to avoid adding
this scan handler (and all this other scan code) and add a check like
acpi_is_serial_bus_slave() [which checks the device parent versus a list 
of known indirectIO hosts] to not enumerate these children, and do it 
from the LLDD host probe instead (https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/6/16/250)"

Please consider this.
