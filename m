Well, we will try to recover a line if the emeta data cannot be read
or the data fails the crc check, and the recovery path assumes that
the write pointers pointers have been incremented in the pblk stripe
order. We'll get a warning now for all cases if this assumption is not
valid.

For outstanding writes, we can leave no guarantees anyway. If a
presync was attached to a bio, that bio will complete when the write
completes.

It does! I'm not trying to do anything more than warn if the write
pointers are not what we expect them to be.

You're right, we need some sort of superblock and some recovery tool
to make pblk more robust against corruptions.
Now, we get a warning at least :)
