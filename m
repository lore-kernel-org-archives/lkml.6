In reality, a resurrection may not be implemented as a pure revert, but as
the addition of a new architecture, implemented using modern features (DT,
CCF, ...).

Cfr. the resurrected arch/h8300, which doesn't have much in common with
the removed one:

$ git diff --stat v3.12..v4.2 -- arch/h8300
[...]
 197 files changed, 3155 insertions(+), 7849 deletions(-)

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
