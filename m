I was thinking about "return true" here, assuming that userspace generally wants
to ensure itself there won't be page faults when it starts doing something
critical, and if it sees a "false" it will try to do some kind of prefaulting,
possibly in a loop. There might be somebody trying to make sure something is out
of pagecache (it wants to see "false"), but can't think of anything except
benchmarks?
