I was going to comment that "managed" already has a common usage
related to the devm_*() functions, but I don't think that's what you
mean here.  But then I noticed that you're only *moving* this code,
so you couldn't change it anyway.

But I still wonder what "managed" means here.

s/irq vectors/irq vector/
s/correct/correctly/

In general I don't think "correctly" is very useful in changelogs
and comments.  Usually it just means "how *I* think it should be
done", but it doesn't tell anybody else exactly *how* it should be
done.

What does it mean for a driver to handle pre_vectors & post_vectors
"correctly"?  The driver's .setup_affinity() method receives an array
of struct irq_affinity; maybe it means that method should set the
cpumask for each element as it desires.  For @pre_vectors and
@post_vectors, I suppose that means their cpumask would be
irq_default_affinity?

But I guess the .setup_affinity() method means the driver would have
complete flexibility for each vector, and it could use
irq_default_affinity for arbitrary vectors, not just the first few
(@pre_vectors) and the last few (@post_vectors)?

What's the rule for how a driver sets "is_managed"?
