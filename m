As a matter of fact, the RISC-V memory model committee is debating this
exact question at the moment.  Now that I see this thread I'll have to
go back and catch up on what I've missed, but at least I can be on cc
from this point on to answer any RISC-V questions that come up from
here on.

(Is there some place I should add my name as a RISC-V memory model
contact, so I don't miss threads like this in the future?)

And yes, if we go with a purely RCpc interpretation of acquire and
release, then I don't believe the writes in the previous critical
section would be ordered with the writes in the subsequent critical
section.  That's really all the argument boils down to.  We'd like
to support RCpc if we can since that's all some software needs, but
we also obviously want to make sure we can support RCsc and these
kinds of LKMM subtleties efficiently too when needed.  So we have a
few encoding details that we're still finalizing, because questions
like this one are still popping up :)

Let me know if you had other RISC-V-specific questions I can help
answer.
