I was waiting for a better explanation from you of what we're trying to
achieve. If you want to take the "do nothing" approach then a list
also of what migrations succeed/fail/break in that case would also
be useful.

(I am somewhat lazily trying to avoid having to spend time reverse
engineering the "what are we trying to do and what effects are
we accepting" parts from the patch and the code that's already gone
into the kernel.)
