My English is quite limited;). I think I did not explain it well in the WrapDrive
document. Please let me try again here:

The requirement of WrapDrive is simple. Many acceleration requirements are from
user space, such as OpenSSL, AI, and so on. We want to provide a framework for
the user land application to summon the accelerator easily.

So the scenario is simple: The application is doing its job and faces a tough
and boring task, say compression. Then it drops the data pointer to the command
queue and let the accelerator do it at its bidding, and continue its job until
the task is done, or its other task synchronously

My understanding to the dma-buf is driver oriented. The buffer is created by one
driver and exported as fd to user space, then the user space can share it with
some attached devices.

But our scenario is that the whole buffer is from the user space. The
application will directly assign the pointer to the command queue. The hardware
will directly use this address.  The kernel should set this particular virtual
memory or the whole process space to the IOMMU with its pasid. So the hardware
can use the process' address, which may not only be the address assigning in the
command queue, it can also be an address inside the memory itself.

To let this work, we have to pin the memory or set a page fault handler when the
memory is shared (to the hardware). And... the big work of pinning memory is not
gup (get user page), but rlimit accounting:)

Yes, we can release the whole page table based on PASID (It also need Jean to
provide this interface;)). But the gup part still need to be tracked. (This is
what is done in VFIO)

Yes, this is going to be something like NOIOMMU mode in VFIO. The hardware have
to accept DMA/physical address. But anyway, this not the major intension of
WrapDrive.

Your idea hints me that the dma_buf design is based on sharing memory from the
driver, not from the user space. That's why the signal is based on the buffer
itself, because the buffer can be used again and again.

This is good for performance. The cost is high if remap the data every time. But
if consider we can devote the whole application space with SVM/SVA support. This
can become acceptable.

Forcing the application to use the device allocate memory is an alluring choice,
it makes thing simple. Let us consider it for a while...
