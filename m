Are sectors fixed size?  I.e., can 2 different physical storage devices have
different sized sectors?
or is this just the "traditional" 512-byte sector?

I know that you have already answered a few comments about endianness,
so maybe you answered this and I missed it.

Can a bcachefs fs be shared, a la NFS?  I.e., can multiple different-endian
clients be accessing the same bcachefs?
