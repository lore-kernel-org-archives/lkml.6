Hi Hao,

Currently there is one set of functions that handles port enable,
disable, and reset and it's in dfl.c and dfl.h, so that's not in any
driver module that can be switched out if necessary for a different
implementation of the port.  Finding a way for this patchset to be
structured for DFL to control what low level manager/port drivers are
used is the current challenge that I've got a lot of my attention on.

Thanks for the explanations on how virtualization affects how this can
be implemented.

Thanks for the explanation.  Does the current implementation allows
the port's PORT_CTRL_SFTRST reset bit to be controlled by PF and VF at
the same time?  Or is the idea that the VF has to be given up in order
to allow the FME PF to be able to reprogram?  After the AFU and port
is turned into a VF, is the port's memory range is mapped in both the
PF and the VF?

That was what I was hoping would work here.  But if the module isn't
loaded because it failed due to the reset controller in the AFU driver
went away, then, yes, that won't work.

Yes I'm trying to find ways to get away from that kind of hard
dependency.  So when someone uses this with a different port, it won't
be a huge rewrite of dfl.c and dfl.h.  I understand that the port is
used by both the AFU and the PR code, that's why it's in a file that
is included by both of them.  That's going to be a problem as soon as
this is used with a different port.

Maybe that is the way forward.  I'm still thinking about this.  So the
DFL will create a AFU driver that includes the port.  If someone
implements a different port, there would be a different id to cause
that AFU driver to be loaded instead.  It seems a shame that more of
the AFU code couldn't be reused. That was the original idea of
fpga-bridge.  Unfortunately it seems that the bridge is needed by both
the VF and PF so it's complicated by that.

Since this is open source, it's important to remember that vendors
aren't the only ones driving development of Linux.  Any user of FPGA
under Linux can (and has) come along and add to this subsystem.  This
code should not discourage that.

I think it's what we need.

They would have to implement a static image with port registers that
function the same way for at least port enable/disable/reset.  If they
need to tweak the driver implementation for their hardware then that's
not possible or it's ugly at least.  This is also the case if you have
some newer version of you port while keeping legacy support for your
original port.

I understand that virtualization is making this hard.  Thanks for
thinking about how this can move forward on this issue.
