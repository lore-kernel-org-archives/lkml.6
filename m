There have been several ways I've seen:
- resulting kernel silently doesn't provide the stack protection at all
- resulting build fails at the end trying to link against a missing
global stack canary
- resulting kernel doesn't boot at all due to insane function preamble
on first use of canary

I *thought* it was rare (i.e. gcc 4.2) but while working on ..._AUTO I
found breakage in akpm's 4.4 gcc, and all of Arnd's gccs due to some
very strange misconfiguration between the gcc build environment and
other options. So, it turns out this is unfortunately common. The good
news is that it does NOT appear to happen with most distro compilers,
though I've seen Android's compiler regress the global vs %gs at least
once about a year ago.

I think it would work to skip KBUILD_CPPFLAGS right up until it
didn't. Since we have the arch split, we can already add -m32 to the
32-bit case, etc. However, I worry about interaction with other
selected build options. For example, while retpoline doesn't interact
stack-protector, it's easy to imagine things that might.

(And in thinking about this, does Kconfig know the true $CC in use?
i.e. the configured cross compiler, etc?)

Old? That's not the case. The check for -fno-stack-protector will
likely be needed forever, as some distro compilers enable
stack-protector by default. So when someone wants to explicitly build
without stack-protector (or if the compiler's stack-protector is
detected as broken), we must force it off for the kernel build.

That would have been nice, yes. :(

That's just the most recent case (from the case where some distro
compilers enabled PIE by default). And was why I was hoping to drop
the scripts entirely.

Yes, exactly.

The reason I built the _AUTO support was to make this easier for
people to not have to think about. I wanted to get rid of explicit
support (i.e. _REGULAR or _STRONG) but some people didn't want _STRONG
(since it has greater code-size impact than _REGULAR), so we've had to
keep that too.

That doesn't happy either before nor after _AUTO. The default value
before was _NONE, and the default value after is _AUTO, which will use
whatever is available.

Agreed; I want to do whatever we can to simplify things. :)

As long as the feature tests include actual compiler output tests,
yeah, this seems fine.

This should be fine too (though by this point, I think Kconfig would
already know the specific option, so it could just pass it with a
single output (CC_OPT_STACKPROTECTOR below?)

Another case I mentioned before that I just want to make sure we don't
reintroduce the problem of getting "stuck" with a bad .config file.
While adding _STRONG support, I discovered the two-phase Kconfig
resolution that happens during the build. If you selected _STRONG with
a strong-capable compiler, everything was fine. If you then tried to
build with an older compiler, you'd get stuck since _STRONG wasn't
support (as detected during the first Kconfig phase) so the
generated/autoconf.h would never get updated with the newly selected
_REGULAR). I moved the Makefile analysis of available stack-protector
options into the second phase (i.e. after all the Kconfig runs), and
that worked to both unstick such configs and provide a clear message
early in the build about what wasn't available.

If all this detection is getting moved up into Kconfig, I'm worried
we'll end up in this state again. If the answer is "you have to delete
autoconf.h if you change compilers", then that's fine, but it sure
seems unfriendly. :)
