Yes, ck610 is a cpu core of abiv1. and I will change it like this:
	model = "Zhuxian-sword gx6605s Development Board";
	compatible = "zhuxian-sword,gx6605s";
ref: https://c-sky.github.io/docs/gx6605s.html

Sorry, I forget remove the cpu region. It's no use now.

Ok

Ok

Ok, I will add them.

I want to keep bootargs in dts, because the bootloader only pass the dtb to kernel.

Ok
