Ok, I noticed that current policy in tests gives exec permission to 
mounter for ro_t file and that's why inode_permission(MAY_EXEC) does
not fail.

can_exec(test_overlay_mounter_t, test_overlay_files_ro_t)

Talked to Dan and he mentioned that he was trying to test entrypoint
failure (and not exec failure) and that's whey he might have allowed exec
to mounter.

I think that current entrypoint test's expectations are wrong.
User process sees overlay inode lablel which is rwx_t and that means
overlay layer will allow entrypoint into that executable. This will be the
behavior on a normal file system where underlying file's label will be
completely overridden by context=.

So in my opinion, we should modify testsuite and not run this test with
context= mounts.

Only little thing to argue is that should we check if mounter has the
permission for this entrypoint. And currently SELinux checks are not
two level checks. So this can be implemented once SELinux is made
aware of multiple levels (if we ever do that).

Thanks
