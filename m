Hi Mike,
as you can imagine, I didn't get any failure in my pre-submission
tests on this patch.  In addition, it is not that easy to link this
patch, which just adds some internal bfq housekeeping in case of a
requeue, with a corruption of external lists for general I/O
management.

In this respect, as Oleksandr comments point out, by switching from
cfq to bfq, you switch between much more than two schedulers.  Anyway,
who knows ...

Maybe this report will ring a bell with some block-layer expert, or,
hopefully, next feedback will help puzzle this out.

Thanks,
Paolo
