I did some testing during the holidays. Here are the observations:

1) With just your patch (without any additional debug patch), if I run
DLPAR on /off operations on a system that has SMT=off, I am able to
see a crash involving RTAS stack corruption within an hour's time.

2) With the debug patch (appended below) which has additional debug to
capture the callers of stop-self, start-cpu, set-power-levels, the
system is able to perform DLPAR on/off operations on a system with
SMT=off for three days. And then, it crashed with the dead CPU showing
a "Bad kernel stack pointer". From this log, I can clearly
see that there were no concurrent calls to stop-self, start-cpu,
set-power-levels. The only concurrent RTAS calls were the dying CPU
calling "stop-self", and the CPU running the DLPAR operation calling
"query-cpu-stopped-state". The crash signature is appended below as
well.

3) Modifying your patch to remove the udelay and increase the loop
count from 25 to 1000 doesn't improve the situation. We are still able
to see the crash.

4) With my patch, even without any additional debug, I was able to
observe the system run the tests successfully for over a week (I
started the tests before the Christmas weekend, and forgot to turn it
off!)

It appears that there is a narrow race window involving rtas-stop-self
and rtas-query-cpu-stopped-state calls that can be observed with your
patch. Adding any printk's seems to reduce the probability of hitting
this race window. It might be worth the while to check with RTAS
folks, if they suspect something here.

The Crash log with this debug patch is as follows
