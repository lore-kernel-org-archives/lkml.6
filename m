Hmm. current_avg is world readable; if it does changes to the
hardware, that's somehow bad.

But I guess I can sample charge_counter every minute or so and get
what I need?

I agree this should not be done in kernel as it requires persistent
storage.

Battery is not user-replacable (and this will recalibrate itself on
charge/discharge cycle) so.. I don't think keying is strictly
neccessary for D4.
