Interesting question.
For the current use in NFS, it is consistent with existing practice to
ignore the name space.
NFS file accesses (when using the normal uid-based access checks) always
use the manifest uid of the process - the one returned by getuid() (or
more accurately, getfsuid()).
Maybe this is wrong?  Maybe we should always use from_kuid() or whatever
to get the uid/gid to send over the wire?

Anna/Trond: do you have thoughts on this?  If a process in a user
namespace accesses a file over NFS, should the UID presented to the
server be the one in that name-space, or the one you get by mapping to
the global name-space?
Or should we map to the namespace that was active when the filesystem
was mounted?

I don't think cred_fscmp() should do any of this mapping, but maybe it
should treat creds from different namespaces as different - as a
precaution.

Thanks,
NeilBrown
