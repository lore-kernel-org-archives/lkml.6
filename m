Since GCC 7 the compiler knows how to do this, for powerpc; in GCC 8
it has improved still.

Yup.

This is incorrect, it does not get the sign of the result correct.
Say when comparing 0xff 0xff 0xff 0xff to 0 0 0 0.  This should return
positive, but it returns negative.

For Power9 GCC does

        lwz 3,0(3)
        lwz 9,0(4)
        cmpld 7,3,9
        setb 3,7

and for Power7/Power8,

        lwz 9,0(3)
        lwz 3,0(4)
        subfc 3,3,9
        popcntd 3,3
        subfe 9,9,9
        or 3,3,9

(and it gives up for earlier CPUs, there is no nice simple code sequence
as far as we know.  Code size matters when generating inline code).

(Generating code for -m32 it is the same, just w instead of d in a few
places).

It's not correct either (same problem as with length 4).
