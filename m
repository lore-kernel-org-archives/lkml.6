I think we should keep this discussion for a later, separate thread. Vincenzo's 
proposal is about allowing userspace to pass tags at the syscall interface. The set 
of mappings allowed to be tagged by userspace (in MTE) should be contained in the set 
of mappings that userspace can pass tagged pointers to (at the syscall interface), 
but they are not necessarily the same. Private read-only mappings are an edge case 
(you can pass tagged pointers to them, the memory may or may not be mapped as tagged, 
but in any case it is not possible to change the memory tags via such mapping).

MTE can be used both for diagnostics (imprecise mode is especially suitable for 
that), and to halt execution when something wrong is detected. Even in the latter 
case, one cannot expect exhaustive checking from MTE, because the way it works is 
fundamentally statistical; an invalid pointer may by chance have the right tag to 
access the given location. So again, I think that a best-effort approach is 
appropriate when the kernel accesses user memory, in terms of checking that tags match.

More specifically, different use-cases come with different tradeoffs (performance / 
tag check coverage). That's why I am suggesting that in the cases where tag checks 
would need to be done _explicitly_ (before losing the user-provided tag), it would be 
nice to be able to choose how much should be checked. I am not suggesting that always 
checking all the granules by default is sane. Maybe checking just the first granule 
is the right default.

I don't think we need to get to the bottom of this specific aspect at this point. 
This ABI proposal is not about memory tagging, so there is no need to specify how or 
when tag checking is done. As long as this ABI allows tagged pointers, pointing to 
mappings that could be potentially tagged, to be passed to syscalls, I don't think 
further relaxations are needed to enable memory tagging.
