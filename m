I meant that the attacker doing the rename must've taken &rename_lock
or &mount_lock after __d_path returns in the target process (because the
race being examined is that the rename occurs *after* __d_path) and thus
are guaranteed to be detected).

Maybe there's a better way to phrase what I mean...

This is already an issue with __d_path (even if the buffer was larger)
because it will not output a path longer than PATH_MAX. I imagine this
is a pretty strong argument for why we should refactor __d_path so that
we can *just* use the escape checking to avoid -ENAMETOOLONG.

I can work on this, but I'll wait until after LPC to see what the
discussion there brings up.

For AT_BENEATH, nd_jump_root() will always return -EXDEV -- but I'll
take your point for AT_THIS_ROOT below.

This is a good point. When I changed this from always being -EXDEV in my
other postings, I was thinking about "/.." rather than the case you've
outlined where ".." is in the path but it's not actually meant to go to
the root.

I agree -EXDEV makes much more sense here. I will add this to my tree
(but I'll wait until after LPC before I send out a new series).
