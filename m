Doesn't guest EL1 access of ptrauth registers go through trap_ptrauth
instead?

We don't call this code in the !VHE case anymore, so are the __hyp_text
annotations still needed?

If all CPUs support address authentication, but no CPUs support generic
authentication, then I think the guest will still see address auth in
the ID register and try to use it, but since kvm_supports_ptrauth() ==
false, then kvm will enable trapping and inject an undef. So I think we
still need to zero the ID register bits here if !kvm_supports_ptrauth().

In the following patch, I think we also need to zero the bits if
!kvm_arm_vcpu_ptrauth_allowed(), as done in v4 [1], because otherwise
the guest will see that ptrauth is available, but will receive an undef
when it tries to use it.

Regarding the patch in v4, most of the work is passing the vcpu down to
read_id_reg(). Dave has a similar patch in his SVE series [2]. I think
it might make sense to rebase onto that patch and mention that patch as
a dependency in the cover letter.
