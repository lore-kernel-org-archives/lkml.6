I've taken this series for a test run, and noticed that it breaks
kvmtool:

<quote>
maz@sy-borg:~$ ./kvmtool/lkvm run -c 1 -k Image --irqchip=gicv3
  # lkvm run -k Image -m 256 -c 1 --name guest-4929
  Info: Loaded kernel to 0x80080000 (20126208 bytes)
  Info: Placing fdt at 0x8fe00000 - 0x8fffffff
  Info: virtio-mmio.devices=0x200@0x10000:36

  Info: virtio-mmio.devices=0x200@0x10200:37

  Info: virtio-mmio.devices=0x200@0x10400:38

KVM_RUN failed: No such device or address
</quote>

Backing out the series results in a working setup.

I presume that the changes in the init has resulted in a stricter
initialization order that matches the QEMU flow, but that kvmtool
doesn't follow.

Could you please have a look at this? I'd like to have it in for 4.18,
just without regressions... ;-)

Thanks,

	M.
