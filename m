I certainly agree on that in general, but at the same time it makes the
expected submission of bcachefs not having to carry a number of
(essentially) unrelated patches. I'm assuming the likelihood of bcachefs
being submitted soonish is high, hence we won't have exports that don't
have in-kernel users in the longer term.
