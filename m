Interesting problem ! But what is special here, I would think syscalls in general 
could hit this.

Well it is broken wrt the semantics the syscall is supposed to provide. Preemption 
disabling is what prevents a concurrent thread from coming in and modifying the 
same location (Imagine a variable which is being cmpxchg concurrently by 2 threads).

One approach is to do it the MIPS way, emulate the llsc flag - set it under 
preemption disabled section and clear it in switch_to

see arch/mips/kernel/syscall.c
