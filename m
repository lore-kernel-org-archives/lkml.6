Perhaps I (and a number of other people ...) have misunderstood the
semantics of GFP_DMA32.  Perhaps GFP_DMA32 is not "allocate memory below
4GB", perhaps it's "allocate memory which can be mapped below 4GB".
Machines with an IOMMU can use ZONE_NORMAL.  Machines with no IOMMU can
choose to allocate memory with a physical address below 4GB.

After all, it has 'DMA' right there in the name.  If someone's relying
on it to allocate physical memory below 4GB, they're arguably misusing it.
