We've learnt this lesson the hard way over and over again: don't
parse untrusted input in privileged contexts. How many times do we
have to make the same mistakes before people start to learn from
them?

User automounting of removable storage should be done via a
privilege separation mechanism and hence avoid this whole class of
security problems. We can get this separation by using FUSE in these
situations, right?

There's little we can do to prevent people from exploiting
flaws in the filesystem's on-disk format. No filesystem has robust,
exhaustive verification of all it's metadata, nor is that
something we can really check at runtime due to the complexity
and overhead of runtime checking.

And then when you consider all the avenues to data exposure and
unprivileged runtime manipulation of on-disk metadata (e.g.
intentionally cross linking critical metadata blocks into user
data files), it's pretty obvious that untrusted filesystem images
are not something that should *ever* be parsed in a privileged
context.

There's "taking it seriously" and then there's "understanding that
we can't stop new exploits from being developed because they
exploit a flaw in the trust model".

i.e. kernel filesystems are built on a directly connected trust
model where the storage "guarantees" it will return exactly what the
filesystem has stored in it.  Hence our filesystems are not built
around tamper-evident/tamper-proof structures and algorithms that
are needed to robustly detect 3rd-party manipulation because their
trust model says they don't need to defend against such attacks.

As such, the most robust way I can see of defending *the kernel*
against malicious/untrusted filesystem images is to move parsing of
those images out of the kernel privilege context altogether. The
parser can then be sandboxed appropriately as you suggested and
we've avoided the problem of kernel level exploits from malicious
filesystem images....

Bugs don't have to be exploitable to be a "security issue". Detected
filesystem corruptions on a errors=panic mount, or undetected
problems that cause a x/NULL deref are still a user-triggerable
kernel crash (i.e. a DOS) and therefore considered a security
problem.

The fact you are currently finding and fixing buffer overuns in ext4
solidly demonstrates my point about existing filesystems being
largely untrustable and unfixable. :/

Cheers,

Dave.
