I feel like you're just moving the rug out from under us... Before you
said ignore HMM and I was asking about the use case that wasn't using
HMM and how it works without HMM. In response, you just give me *way*
too much information describing HMM. And still, as best as I can see,
managing DMA mappings (which is different from the userspace mappings)
for GPU P2P should be handled by HMM and the userspace mappings should
*just* link VMAs to HMM pages using the standard infrastructure we
already have.

This isn't answering my question at all... I specifically asked what is
backing the VMA when we are *not* using HMM.
