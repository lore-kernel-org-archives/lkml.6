Not sure what 'FS resp. IO' means here -- 'FS and IO' ?

(Or is this one of those things where this looks like plain English text
but in reality it's some sort of markup that I'm not so familiar with?)

Confused because I've seen 'resp.' used as shorthand for
'responsible'...

I think this sentence is a little redundant with the previous sentence,
you could chop it out and join this paragraph to the one before it.

Otherwise looks ok to me based on my understanding of how all this is
supposed to work...
