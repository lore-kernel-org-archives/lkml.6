All I really care about is that when you ask for a set of paramaters
that you get a filesystem with that set of parameters.  Not the same
filsystem mounted a different way.

That has gone wrong twice badly.  There is no common case I know of that
requires returning the same filesystem twice.  AKA the pain of the
existing semantics seems much much worse than any benefit.  So I am
asking that we not propagate the existing semantics into the new API.
You are cleaning up dealing with mount options and this is one of the
places where they need cleaning up.

What I am asking is that the default behavior for the new API when using
FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE is to call sget_fc with either FSOPEN_EXCL or
FSOPEN_FAIL_ON_MISMATCH.  I know FSOPEN_EXCL is trivial to implement.  I
don't know if there are any hidden gotcha's with
FSOPEN_FAIL_ON_MISMATCH.

This change in default behavior for your patch needs to be implemented
before this hits a released kernel.  Returning a filesystem with
different than the requested parameters has resulted in at least two
major issues, that are very hard to clean up after the fact.  A chroot
system changing the parameters on /dev/pts resulting in some
distributions keeping the suid pt_chown binary long past it's best buy
date, and other distributions instead choosing to break userspace.  Then
there is the current issue where in practice proc does not any of it's
mount paramaters which breaks the android security model.

The fact that these things happen silently and you have to be on your
toes to catch them is fundamentally a bug in the API.  If the mount
request had simply failed people would have noticed the issues much
sooner and silently b0rkend configuration would not have propagated.  As
such I do not believe we should propagate this misfeature from the old
API into the new API.

Conceptually I like FSOPEN_FAIL_ON_MISMATH as it looks like it is
sufficient to the needs, and with a little luck we could even change
the old API to those semantics.


Ultimately I want to close a giant mental model mismatch.

User:  I am creating the data structures to read filesystem X
       with parameters Y.

Kernel: He wants filesystem X.  If it is a slow day use parameters Y.

Given that historically the reuse of a superblock did not exist, and
that in practice it almost never happens.  It is quite reqsonable for
users to not expect the kernel to completely ignore the mount parameters
they pass to the kernel.

So please let's fix that now when it is easy.

Eric
