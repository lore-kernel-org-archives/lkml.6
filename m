In hfi1, do_pcie_gen3_transition() resets the device.  I don't know if
retraining the link would be sufficient; maybe the reset is required
to make the device use the new firmware.  I guess we already export
reset interfaces, so if we add a retrain interface, drivers could
choose what they need.

Can we just make it the driver's problem by returning -EPERM if one
function requests a retrain while another function is in use?
