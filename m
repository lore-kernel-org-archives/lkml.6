Hey,

Hadn't really followed this discussion much due to other fires
elsewhere :-)

I can see how you might want to have that kind of behaviour, but you'd
have to jump through some hoops to see if the coredump you saw is
actually the right one - you probably want an asynchronous coredump
"collector" and then wait for it to show up (with some reasonable
timeout) on the actual filesystem, not on sysfs?

Otherwise you have to trawl sysfs for the right coredump I guess, which
too is possible.

There isn't really, it originally was really simple, but then somebody
(Kees perhaps?) requested a way to turn it off forever for security or
privacy concerns and it became more complicated.

I'm not sure it matters all that much - the underlying devcoredump
calls all have no return value (void), and given the above complexities
with the ability to turn off devcoredumping entirely you cannot rely on
this return value to tell you if a dump was created or not, at least
not without much more infrastructure work.
