Hi Jens,=0A=
=0A=
What is the scenario that you see under which the woken up task does not=0A=
get to run?=0A=
=0A=
The theory behind leaving the task on the wait queue is that the=0A=
waitqueue_active check in wbt_wait prevents new tasks from taking up a=0A=
slot in the queue (e.g. incrementing inflight). So, there should not be=0A=
a way for inflight to be incremented between the time the wake_up is=0A=
done and the task at the head of the wait queue runs. That's the idea=0A=
anyway :-) If we missed something, let us know.=0A=
