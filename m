I appreciate that you're working on this, but can you please send the full
series to the relevant mailing lists, so that everyone has the needed context?
Single random patches for this are basically impossible to review.  OFC that
also means including a cover letter that explains the overall problem and your
solution.  In the Cc list I also recommend including the ext4 maintainer
Theodore Ts'o <tytso@mit.edu>, who led a discussion at LSFMM 2017 about this
topic (https://lwn.net/Articles/717754/), and the f2fs maintainer Jaegeuk Kim
<jaegeuk@kernel.org> who has had to deal with this stuff in an Android device
kernel, but for another vendor's inline encryption hardware.  I assume your
solution will work for other vendors too?  I think inline encryption is part of
the latest UFS specificaton now, so the latest hardware does it in a
"standardized" way and doesn't require ad-hoc vendor-specific stuff --- right?
And do you have any plans for inline encryption support with fscrypt (ext4/f2fs
encryption, a.k.a. what Android calls "File-Based Encryption")?  We need a
design for inline encryption in the upstream kernel that is sufficiently general
to work for all these vendors and use cases, not just specific ones.

Just at a quick glance, you also seem to be abusing the crypto API by exposing
inline encryption capabilities as a skcipher_alg.  With inline encryption by
definition you can't actually do encryption outside of a block device request;
as a result, your patch has to use a fallback algorithm to do the actual
encryption for the skcipher_alg, which makes no sense.  So it is not at all
clear to me that you should use the crypto API at all, as opposed to having it
be purely a block layer thing.  (Please also Cc linux-crypto if you are doing
significant work related to the crypto API.)
