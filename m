Hi Bjorn,

Sorry for the delay - I was on a business trip.

No, but I'm not native speaker :)

It is not directly described in the spec (unfortunately). In general
they leave a lot for the reader to interpret instead of explaining how
the thing is supposed to be programmed in different situations :(

This is the behavior I see when the hierarchy goes into D3cold. I don't
have any equipment that would let me see what exactly happens there. The
above is my guess of what happens.

Sure, I can add those references to the changelog.

Sure, I'll add a comment.
