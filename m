Well a long term problem with hugepage_migration_supported is that it is
used in two different context 1) to bail out from the migration early
because the arch doesn't support migration at all and 2) to use movable
zone for hugetlb pages allocation. I am especially concerned about the
later because the mere support for migration is not really good enough.
Are you really able to find a different giga page during the runtime to
move an existing giga page out of the movable zone?

So I guess we want to split this into two functions
arch_hugepage_migration_supported and hugepage_movable. The later would
be a reasonably migrateable subset of the former. Without that this
patch migth introduce subtle regressions when somebody relies on movable
zone to be really movable.
