Hi Jens, all,
let me push for this interface to be fixed too.  If we don't fix it in
some way, then from 4.21 we well end up with a ridiculous paradox: the
proportional share policy (weights) will of course be available, but
unusable in practice.  In fact, as Lennart--and not only Lennart--can
confirm, no piece of code uses bfq.weight to set weights, or will do
it.

A trivial solution would be to throw away all our work to fix this
issue by extending the interface, and just let bfq use the former cfq
names.  But then the same mess will happen as, e.g., Josef will
propose his proportional-share controller.

Before making this solution, we proposed it and waited for it to be
approved several months ago, so I hope that Tejun concern can be
addressed somehow.

If Tejun cannot see any solution to his concern, then can we just
switch to this extension, considering that
- for non-shared names the interface is *identical* to the current
  one;
- by using this new interface, and getting feedback we could
  understand how to better handle Tejun's concern?

A lot of systems do use weights, and people don't even know that these
systems don't work correctly in blk-mq.  And they won't work correctly
in any available configuration from 4.21, if we don't fix this problem.

Thanks.
Paolo
