I'm not sure that using root or group restricted access to a character
device is going to stop an ISV from embracing a technology, but that
is an alternate debate.

Relying on discretionary, or mandatory for that matter, access
controls is not consistent with the security architecture of SGX.  The
technology was designed to provide robustness in the face of
aggressors who may have compromised the operating system or hardware
platform.

The lingua franca of SGX security and access controls are MRSIGNER
values.  The SFLC patches that we will be making available, once we
are convinced the upstream driver is working, implement MRSIGNER based
security controls with an absolutely minimal TCB footprint in the
kernel.  This strategy allows the platform owner to use SGX compliant
and cryptographically enforced access controls.

Just as an aside, secondary to our perception that this technology and
what it can do is not widely understood, we are developing a 2-part
LWN article series on SGX and its implications for Linux.
