Hi Ted,

Do you mean why syzbot considers kernel panics as something to report?
Or why syzbot has not understood why this panic is somehow special?
syzbot doesn't report only security problems. It just reports bugs.
E.g. NULL derefs and deadlocks are also not security bugs, but are
reported.

Can you please give me background regarding purpose of this flag?
What's the intended use case? And what exactly is corrupted?
If kernel detects that an image is corrupted during mount shouldn't it
just report an error? If I am reading this correctly, any USB cable
that plug into my computer can shut it down. Or maybe even existing
cables can shut down all computers in a country on a remote command.
Am I missing something here?
