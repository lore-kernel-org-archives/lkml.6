+.SH NAME
+fsopen, fsmount, fspick \- Handle filesystem (re-)configuration and mounting
+.SH SYNOPSIS

+.B #include <sys/types.h>
+.br
+.B #include <sys/mount.h>
+.br
+.B #include <unistd.h>
+.br
+.BR "#include <fcntl.h>           " "/* Definition of AT_* constants */"

+.BI "int fsopen(const char *" fsname ", unsigned int " flags );
+.PP
+.BI "int fsmount(int " fd ", unsigned int " flags ", unsigned int " ms_flags );
+.PP
+.BI "int fspick(int " dirfd ", const char *" pathname ", unsigned int " flags );
+.fi
+.PP
+.IR Note :
+There are no glibc wrappers for these system calls.
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.PP
+.BR fsopen ()
+creates a new filesystem configuration context within the kernel for the
+filesystem named in the
+.I fsname
+parameter and attaches it to a file descriptor, which it then returns.  The
+file descriptor can be marked close-on-exec by setting
+.B FSOPEN_CLOEXEC
+in flags.
+.PP
+The
+file descriptor can then be used to configure the desired filesystem parameters
+and security parameters by using
+.BR write (2)
+to pass parameters to it and then writing a command to actually create the
+filesystem representation.
+.PP
+The file descriptor also serves as a channel by which more comprehensive error,
+warning and information messages may be retrieved from the kernel using
+.BR read (2).
+.PP
+Once the kernel's filesystem representation has been created, it can be queried
+by calling
+.BR fsinfo (2)
+on the file descriptor.  fsinfo() will spot that the target is actually a
+creation context and look inside that.
+.PP
+.BR fsmount ()
+can then be called to create a mount object that refers to the newly created
+filesystem representation, with the propagation and mount restrictions to be
+applied specified in
+.IR ms_flags .
+The mount object is then attached to a new file descriptor that looks like one
+created by
+.BR open "(2) with " O_PATH " or " open_tree (2).
+This can be passed to
+.BR move_mount (2)
+to attach the mount object to a mountpoint, thereby completing the process.
+.PP
+The file descriptor returned by fsmount() is marked close-on-exec if
+FSMOUNT_CLOEXEC is specified in
+.IR flags .
+.PP
+After fsmount() has completed, the context created by fsopen() is reset and
+moved to reconfiguration state, allowing the new superblock to be reconfigured.
+.PP
+.BR fspick ()
+creates a new filesystem context within the kernel, attaches the superblock
+specified by
+.IR dfd ", " pathname ", " flags
+and puts it into the reconfiguration state and attached the context to a new
+file descriptor that can then be parameterised with
+.BR write (2)
+exactly the same as for the context created by fsopen() above.
+.PP
+.I flags
+is an OR'd together mask of
+.B FSPICK_CLOEXEC
+which indicates that the returned file descriptor should be marked
+close-on-exec and
+.BR FSPICK_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW ", " FSPICK_NO_AUTOMOUNT " and " FSPICK_EMPTY_PATH
+which control the pathwalk to the target object (see below).
+
+.\"________________________________________________________
+.SS Writable Command Interface
+Superblock (re-)configuration is achieved by writing command strings to the
+context file descriptor using
+.BR write (2).
+Each string is prefixed with a specifier indicating the class of command
+being specified.  The available commands include:
+.TP
+\fB"o <option>"\fP
+Specify a filesystem or security parameter.
+.I <option>
+is typically a key or key=val format string.  Since the length of the option is
+given to write(), the option may include any sort of character, including
+spaces and commas or even binary data.
+.TP
+\fB"s <name>"\fP
+Specify a device file, network server or other other source specification.
+This may be optional, depending on the filesystem, and it may be possible to
+provide multiple of them to a filesystem.
+.TP
+\fB"x create"\fP
+End the filesystem configuration phase and try and create a representation in
+the kernel with the parameters specified.  After this, the context is shifted
+to the mount-pending state waiting for an fsmount() call to occur.
+.TP
+\fB"x reconfigure"\fP
+End a filesystem reconfiguration phase try to apply the parameters to the
+filesystem representation.  After this, the context gets reset and put back to
+the start of the reconfiguration phase again.
+.PP
+With this interface, option strings are not limited to 4096 bytes, either
+individually or in sum, and they are also not restricted to text-only options.
+Further, errors may be given individually for each option and not aggregated or
+dumped into the kernel log.
+
+.\"________________________________________________________
+.SS Message Retrieval Interface
+The context file descriptor may be queried for message strings at any time by
+calling
+.BR read (2)
+on the file descriptor.  This will return formatted messages that are prefixed
+to indicate their class:
+.TP
+\fB"e <message>"\fP
+An error message string was logged.
+.TP
+\fB"i <message>"\fP
+An informational message string was logged.
+.TP
+\fB"w <message>"\fP
+An warning message string was logged.
+.PP
+Messages are removed from the queue as they're read.
+
+.\"________________________________________________________
+.SH EXAMPLES
+To illustrate the process, here's an example whereby this can be used to mount
+an ext4 filesystem on /dev/sdb1 onto /mnt.  Note that the example ignores the
+fact that
+.BR write (2)
+has a length parameter and that errors might occur.
+.PP
+.in +4n
+.nf
+sfd = fsopen("ext4", FSOPEN_CLOEXEC);
+write(sfd, "s /dev/sdb1");
+write(sfd, "o noatime");
+write(sfd, "o acl");
+write(sfd, "o user_attr");
+write(sfd, "o iversion");
+write(sfd, "x create");
+fsinfo(sfd, NULL, ...);
+mfd = fsmount(sfd, FSMOUNT_CLOEXEC, MS_RELATIME);
+move_mount(mfd, "", sfd, AT_FDCWD, "/mnt", MOVE_MOUNT_F_EMPTY_PATH);
+.fi
+.in
+.PP
+Here, an ext4 context is created first and attached to sfd.  This is then told
+where its source will be, given a bunch of options and created.
+.BR fsinfo (2)
+can then be used to query the filesystem.  Then fsmount() is called to create a
+mount object and
+.BR move_mount (2)
+is called to attach it to its intended mountpoint.
+.PP
+And here's an example of mounting from an NFS server:
+.PP
+.in +4n
+.nf
+sfd = fsopen("nfs", 0);
+write(sfd, "s example.com/pub/linux");
+write(sfd, "o nfsvers=3");
+write(sfd, "o rsize=65536");
+write(sfd, "o wsize=65536");
+write(sfd, "o rdma");
+write(sfd, "x create");
+mfd = fsmount(sfd, 0, MS_NODEV);
+move_mount(mfd, "", sfd, AT_FDCWD, "/mnt", MOVE_MOUNT_F_EMPTY_PATH);
+.fi
+.in
+.PP
+Reconfiguration can be achieved by:
+.PP
+.in +4n
+.nf
+sfd = fspick(AT_FDCWD, "/mnt", FSPICK_NO_AUTOMOUNT | FSPICK_CLOEXEC);
+write(sfd, "o ro");
+write(sfd, "x reconfigure");
+.fi
+.in
+.PP
+or:
+.PP
+.in +4n
+.nf
+sfd = fsopen(...);
+...
+mfd = fsmount(sfd, ...);
+...
+write(sfd, "o ro");
+write(sfd, "x reconfigure");
+.fi
