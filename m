The init/exit sequences have grown in a very bad way. Refactor them to
eliminate dependencies across initialization modules.

One of these dependencies caused a bad double free when introducing a
preparation patch for 2.0 bad block identification. This was reported by
Dan Carpenter and 0-DAY.

Matias,

Since you have not send the PR to Jens, please squash this patch with:
    lightnvm: pblk: refactor bad block identification

You will notice that I had queued this patch on the 2.0 series. I did
the rebase now, which is probably what I should have done from the
beginning. Since I'll be sending a V5 for it, this should not be a
problem.

Thanks,
Javier
