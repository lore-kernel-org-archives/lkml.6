Well, I do agree but I've also seen terrible things while doing the
conversion when introducing kvmalloc.

So I admit that the defensive mode here is mostly inspired by existing
users of vmalloc(GFP_NOFS). They are simply wrong and not really
eager to be fixed from my experience. Now with kvmalloc fixing them
up silently it would get even less likely to get fixed because there
won't be any deadlock possible (compared to open coded kvmalloc like
ext4_kvmalloc for example).

My experience also tells me that most of those vmalloc NOFS users
simply do not need NOFS at all because there is no risk of the reclaim
recursion deadlocks. They are just used because of cargo cult which is
sad and it causes some subtle problems for the direct reclaim. I would
really like to eliminate those (e.g. see [1]).  It is sad reality that
people tend to be more sensitive to WARN splats than "look this is wrong
albeit not critical in most cases).

[1] http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20180424162712.GL17484@dhcp22.suse.cz

That being sad, if you believe that silently fixing up a code like that
is a good idea we can do the following of course:

Subject: [PATCH] mm: kvmalloc does not fallback to vmalloc for incompatible
 gfp flags

kvmalloc warned about incompatible gfp_mask to catch abusers (mostly
GFP_NOFS) with an intention that this will motivate authors of the code
to fix those. Linus argues that this just motivates people to do even
more hacks like
	if (gfp == GFP_KERNEL)
		kvmalloc
	else
		kmalloc

I haven't seen this happening but it is true that we can grow those in
future. Therefore Linus suggested to simply not fallback to vmalloc for
incompatible gfp flags and rather stick with the kmalloc path.
