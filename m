Which suggests you want one of the negative si_codes, and to use the _rt
siginfo member like sigqueue.

It would help if those numbers were put into the patch description so
people can tell if the mechanism is quick enough.

More work in the man page versus less work in the kernel, and less code
to maintain.  I will vote for more work in the man page.

32bit pointers need to be translated into 64bit pointers.  If the system
call does not zero extend them.  Plus structure sizes.

I think prctl is just inside the line where problems happen but it is so
close to the line of structure size differences that it makes me
nervous.  Typically pointers in structures are what cause system calls
to cross that line.

So far so good.
