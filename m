Reading code there is no THP migration in 4.4 only huge tlb migration.
Look at handle_mm_fault which do not know how to handle swap pmd, only
the huge tlb fs fault handler knows how to handle those. Hence why i
was checking for huge tlb exactly as page_check_address() to only range
invalidate for huge tlb fs migration.

But i am fine with doing the range invalidation with all.
