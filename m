Thanks for picking this one up.

I hate to be a pain ... but before we merge this and proliferate these
names, I'd like to change the names of some of these early asm
functions. They're terribly named due to historical reasons.

I haven't actually thought of good names yet though :)

I'll try and come up with some and post a patch doing the renames.

cheers
