It will do it on the "unsigned long arg" argument, I assume that's
what you meant. The "cmd" argument is correctly zero-extended
by the COMPAT_SYSCALL_DEFINE() wrapper on architectures
that need that (IIRC s390 is in that category).

There is actually one more case: A number of the newer
interfaces that have ioctl structures with indirect pointers
encoded as __u64, so the layout becomes
and we don't normally need a conversion handler.

An example of this would be the sys_rseq() system call
that passes a relatively complex structure in place
of a pointer:

struct rseq {
        ...
        union {
                __u64 ptr64;
#ifdef __LP64__
                __u64 ptr;
#else
                struct {
#if (defined(__BYTE_ORDER) && (__BYTE_ORDER == __BIG_ENDIAN)) ||
defined(__BIG_ENDIAN)
                        __u32 padding;          /* Initialized to zero. */
                        __u32 ptr32;
#else /* LITTLE */
                        __u32 ptr32;
                        __u32 padding;          /* Initialized to zero. */
#endif /* ENDIAN */
                } ptr;
#endif
        } rseq_cs;
       __u32 flags;
};

We require user space to initialize the __padding field to
zero and then use the ptr64 field in the kernel as a pointer:

        u64 ptr;
        u32 __user *usig;
        copy_from_user(&ptr, &t->rseq->rseq_cs.ptr64, sizeof(ptr));
        urseq_cs = (struct rseq_cs __user *)(unsigned long)ptr;

but we don't ever clear bit 31 here. A similar pattern is used
in many device drivers (I could not find any that would apply to
s390 though). In theory, 32 bit user space might pass a pointer
with the high bit set in the ptr32 field, and that gets misinterpreted
by the kernel (resulting in -EFAULT).

It would be interesting to know whether there could be user space
that gets compiled from portable source code with a normal
C compiler but produces that high bit set, as opposed to someone
intentially settting the bit just to trigger the bug.
