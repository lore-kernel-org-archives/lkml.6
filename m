Subject: [for-next][PATCH 15/29] tracing: Make hist trigger Documentation better reflect
 actions/handlers

From: Tom Zanussi <tom.zanussi@linux.intel.com>

The action/handler code refactoring didn't change the action/handler
syntax, but did generalize it - the Documentation should reflect that.

+-------------------------------------------
 
-A hist trigger 'action' is a function that's executed whenever a
-histogram entry is added or updated.
+A hist trigger 'action' is a function that's executed (in most cases
+conditionally) whenever a histogram entry is added or updated.
 
-The default 'action' if no special function is explicitly specified is
-as it always has been, to simply update the set of values associated
-with an entry.  Some applications, however, may want to perform
-additional actions at that point, such as generate another event, or
-compare and save a maximum.
+When a histogram entry is added or updated, a hist trigger 'handler'
+is what decides whether the corresponding action is actually invoked
+or not.
 
-The following additional actions are available.  To specify an action
-for a given event, simply specify the action between colons in the
-hist trigger specification.
+Hist trigger handlers and actions are paired together in the general
+form:
+
+  <handler>.<action>
+
+To specify a handler.action pair for a given event, simply specify
+that handler.action pair between colons in the hist trigger
+specification.
+
+In theory, any handler can be combined with any action, but in
+practice, not every handler.action combination is currently supported;
+if a given handler.action combination isn't supported, the hist
+trigger will fail with -EINVAL;
+
+The default 'handler.action' if none is explicity specified is as it
+always has been, to simply update the set of values associated with an
+entry.  Some applications, however, may want to perform additional
+actions at that point, such as generate another event, or compare and
+save a maximum.
+
+The supported handlers and actions are listed below, and each is
+described in more detail in the following paragraphs, in the context
+of descriptions of some common and useful handler.action combinations.
+
+The available handlers are:
+
+  - onmatch(matching.event)    - invoke action on any addition or update
+  - onmax(var)                 - invoke action if var exceeds current max
+
+The available actions are:
+
+  - <synthetic_event_name>(param list)         - generate synthetic event
+  - save(field,...)                            - save current event fields
+
+The following commonly-used handler.action pairs are available:
 
   - onmatch(matching.event).<synthetic_event_name>(param list)
