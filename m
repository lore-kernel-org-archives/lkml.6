I implemented a psi-monitor prototype which allows userspace to
specify the max PSI stall it can tolerate (in terms of % of time spent
on memory management). When that threshold is breached an event to
userspace is generated. I'm still testing it but early results look
promising. I'm planning to send it upstream when it's ready and after
the main PSI patchset is merged.

Yes it's doable. One usecase might be to poll at a higher rate for a
short period of time immediately after the initial event is received
to clarify the short-term signal dynamics.
