Hi,

I did not have time to investigate the issue in core code that triggers
this defect but this patch is not the solution to the problem it is a
plaster that papers over it, I won't merge it.

I would appreciate some help. If you could have a look at core code that
triggers the failure we can analyze what should be done to make it work,
I do not think it is a defect in your IP.

Lorenzo
