I think one problem here is that we're trying to use one bit of state
(the KVM_GUESTDBG_SINGLESTEP) when we actually need two.

I had expected that we'd follow the architectural single-step state
machine, and have three states:

* inactive/disabled: not single stepping

* active-not-pending: the current instruction will be stepped, and we'll
  transition to active-pending before executing the next instruction.

* active-pending: the current instruction will raise a software step
  debug exception, before being executed.

For that to work, all we have to do is advence the state machine when we
emulate/skip an instruction, and the HW will raise the exception for us
when we enter the guest (which is the only place we have to handle the
step exception).

We need two bits of internal state for that, but KVM only gives us a
single KVM_GUESTDBG_SINGLESTEP flag, and we might exit to userspace
mid-emulation (e.g. for MMIO). To avoid that resulting in skipping two
instructions at a time, we currently add explicit
kvm_arm_handle_step_debug() checks everywhere after we've (possibly)
emulated an instruction, but these seem to hit too often.

One problem is that I couldn't spot when we advance the PC for an MMIO
trap. I presume we do that in the kernel, *after* the MMIO trap, but I
can't see where that happens.

Thanks,
Mark.
