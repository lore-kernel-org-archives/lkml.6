Summary: mke2s uses the BLKDISCARD ioctl to wipe the device,
and then uses BLKDISCARDZEROES to check if that zeroed the data.

A while ago I made BLKDISCARDZEROES always return 0 because it is
basically impossible to have reliably zeroing using discard as the
standards leave the devices way to many options to not actually
zero data at their own choice when using the discard commands.

So IFF mke2fs want to actually free space and zero it it needs
to use fallocate to punch a hole, and mmc needs to implement
REQ_OP_WRITE_ZEROS IFF it actually has a reliable way to zero
blocks.
