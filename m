OK, thanks for checking.  Since there's only one link in the path and
both ends advertise L1SS and LTR support, I wouldn't expect it to make
a difference.

I see other reports of ASPM issues with that Samsung 960 PRO NVMe SSD.
Maybe they're related?

  https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20171214184701.GA6322@libmpq.org
  https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkCentre-A-E-M-S-Series/M900-Tiny-UEFI-Bug-M-2-NVMe-SSD-amp-8260-WiFi-ASPM-disabled-Much/td-p/3570469

You might try setting NVME_QUIRK_NO_APST to see if that's related.
There are some quirks that sound similar:

  8427bbc22486 ("nvme-pci: disable APST on Samsung SSD 960 EVO + ASUS PRIME B350M-A")
  467c77d4cbef ("nvme-pci: disable APST for Samsung NVMe SSD 960 EVO + ASUS PRIME Z370-A")

Keith, et al, here's the relevant part of Srinath's lspci.  Both ends
of the link claim to support ASPM including L1SS and LTR, but Srinath
has to disable ASPM to get the SSD to work reliably.  Just FYI.

Is this platform a lab prototype or is it already shipping?  If it's
already shipping, you probably need some sort of upstream solution
like an NVMe or PCIe quirk, but if not, maybe you can just hack your
bringup kernel to disable ASPM and LTR until you fix the root cause.
