For TCP/IP a SOCK_RAW is a socket with raw IP level access. It doesn't
deal in IP headers and unless you ask it also does chunks of IP header
stuff for you.

SOCK_PACKET is the truely raw interface and even then it's rawness is
bounded. You can't for example talk truely raw wifi bit streams, and for
ethernet you get to generate MAC headers but not preambles etc.

Why - the signal is still floating around in the air, you can't unhear it
at the antenna. If a given piece of hardware needs to flip between RX
and TX mode then it should be handled by that driver.

(Some ancient ethernet cards do this btw.. they can't listen and transmit
at the same time)

Wifi already has the general policy database for the various existing
protocols. Please take a look at the CRDA agent and how it hooks into
wireless.It might need to some tweaking but it would be odd to have
different configuration schemes for different wifi protocols.

Agreed

That's a hardware question. Imagine a software defined radio. If your
limitation wouldn't exist in a pure software defined radio then it's
almost certainly a device level detal.

Agreed if you can flip per packet.

What matters most is mux/demux.

If you've got something listening to data but without the structure
needed to identify multiple listeners and split out the data meaningfully
to those listeners according to parts of the packet then you've got no
reason to make it a protocol just use SOCK_PACKET and if need be BPF.

The reason we have a socket layer not /dev/ethernet0 is that it's
meaningful to divide messages up into flows, and to partition those flows
securely amongst multiple consumers/generators.
