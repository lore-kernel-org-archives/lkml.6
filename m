I was remembering this from reading the nfs mount code:

static int nfs_compare_super(struct super_block *sb, void *data)
{
...
	if (!nfs_compare_super_address(old, server))
		return 0;
	/* Note: NFS_MOUNT_UNSHARED == NFS4_MOUNT_UNSHARED */
	if (old->flags & NFS_MOUNT_UNSHARED)
		return 0;
...
}

If a filesystem has NFS_MOUNT_UNSHARED set it does not serve as a
candidate for new mount requests.  Skimming the code it looks like
nosharecache is what sets NFS_MOUNT_UNSHARED.


Another interesting and common case is tmpfs which always creates a new
filesystem instance whenever it is mounted.
