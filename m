It seems to make little sense at root level indeed.

It might be up to the different scheduling classes I guess. See more on
this below.

So, for DEADLINE this is currently a problem. We know that this is
broken (and Mathieu proposed already patches to fix it [1]). What we
want, I think, is to deny setting a task to DEADLINE if its current
affinity could overlap some exclusive set (root domain as per above), as
for example in your case if the task is residing in the root group.
Since DEADLINE bases load balancing on root domains, once those have
been correctly created, tasks shouldn't be able to escape. And if no
task can reside on the root level once sched_load_balance has been
disable, it seems we won't have the problem you fear.

RT looks similar in this sense (load balancing using root domains info),
but no admission control is performed, so I guess we could fall in your
problematic situation.

FAIR uses a mix of sched domains and root domains information to perform
load balancing, so once tasks are divided among configured sets all
should work OK, but again there might be still some tasks left at root
group. :/ I'm not sure what happens to those w.r.t. load balancing.

Let's see what they think. :)

Thanks for the discussion!
