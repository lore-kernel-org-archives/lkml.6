Funny that we have problems on AMD IOMMU and not with Intel IOMMU.

Thanks for clarify this. So my patch which do:

-		page = virt_to_head_page(data);
+		page = virt_to_page(data);
 		offset = data - page_address(page);
 		sg_set_page(&urb->sg[i], page, sglen, offset);

should not be necessary as IOMMU driver do exactly the same internally.

Are there any alignment requirement for offset for dma_map_{page,sg} ?
It will work with let say sg->offset=113 or we have make sure it is
aligned to some boundary. If so, what boundary ?
