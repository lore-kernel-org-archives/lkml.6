I don't have a strong opinion on this, either.
Ideally, I would like tags to be fully transparent for user space
code. MM syscalls used on a malloc/memalign address are not a very
common pattern, so it might be OK to not allow tags there. But all
such code will have to be changed with explicit knowledge of TBI.
