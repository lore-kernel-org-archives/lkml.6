And this is a massive hammer trying to squash everything. This problem needs to be debugged. And this starts by providing affected SKU information and firmware information. So get the details about the SKU and its Bluetooth and WiFi boot loaders.

our hardware teams from the Bluetooth and WiFi side really need to look at this. An inter-dependency between the firmware loading of two otherwise independent drivers is really not what I want to see upstream. However I have no idea which boot loaders are affected or if this is something that might be even possible to be fixed in operational firmware. If you can create a binary btmon trace file with the error happening and getting really every single message from the boot we might get a bit further to understand where it goes wrong.

Marcel
