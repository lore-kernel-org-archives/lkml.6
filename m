This may come a bit out of left field, but have we considered decoupling
the KVM stage 2 page table manipulation functions even further from the
host page table helpers?  I found some of the patches a bit hard to read
with all the wrappers and folding logic considered, so I'm wondering if
it's possible to write something more generic for stage 2 page table
manipulations which doesn't have to fit within a Linux page table
manipulation nomenclature?

Wasn't this also the decision taken for IOMMU page table allocation, and
why was that the right approach for the IOMMU but not for KVM stage 2
page tables?  Is there room for reuse of the IOMMU page table allocation
logic in KVM as well?

This may have been discussed already, but I'd like to know the arguments
for doing things the way proposed in this series.

Thanks,
-Christoffer
