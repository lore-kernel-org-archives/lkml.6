Speaking as someone who joined this discussion late, maybe years after
it started, it would help to get an overview of existing problems and how
fs_view aims to solve them.

I do believe that both Overlayfs and Btrfs can benefit from a layer of
abstraction
in the VFS, but I think it is best if we start with laying all the
common problems
and then see how a solution would look like.

Even the name of the abstraction (fs_view) doesn't make it clear to me what
it is we are abstracting (security context? st_dev? what else?). probably best
to try to describe the abstraction from user POV rather then give sporadic
examples of what MAY go into fs_view.

While at it, need to see if this discussion has any intersections with David
Howell's fs_context work, because if we consider adding sub volume support
to VFS, we may want to leave some reserved bits in the API for it.

And what is the SUSE way?

FYI, the Overlayfs file/inode mapping is about to change with many
VFS hacks queued for removal, so stay tuned.

Can you please elaborate on that problem.
Do you mean when watching a directory for changes, you need to
be able to tell in which fs_view the directory inode that is being watched?

I have an interest of solving another problem.
In VFS operations where only inode is available, I would like to be able to
report fsnotify events (e.g. fsnotify_move()) only in directories under a
certain subtree root. That could be achieved either by bind mount the subtree
root and passing vfsmount into vfs_rename() or by defining an fs_view on the
subtree and mounting that fs_view.

Thanks,
Amir.
