That's pretty good, although it's just an atrocious vendor driver and
it turns out all of those things are constants, and it'd be far better
off with just declaring an array.  I bet they used to declare one on
the stack ...

Yes, it's not very regular.

I'm reluctant to do away with kcalloc() as it has the obvious heritage
from user-space calloc() with the addition of GFP flags.

Thanks!  And way harder to misuse than kmalloc_ab_c().

Ooh, if neither a nor b is constant, it just didn't do a check ;-(  This
stuff is hard.

Every CPU I ever worked with had an "overflow" bit ... do we have a
friend on the C standards ctte who might figure out a way to let us
write code that checks it?

I'm impressed, but it's not going to catch

	veryLongPointerNameThatsMeaningfulToMe = kmalloc(initialSize +
		numberOfEntries * entrySize + someOtherThing * yourMum,
		GFP_KERNEL);
