From: Jérôme Glisse <jglisse@redhat.com>

Allow mmap of device file to export device memory to peer to peer
devices. This will allow for instance a network device to access a
GPU memory or to access a storage device queue directly.

The common case will be a vma created by userspace device driver
that is then share to another userspace device driver which call
in its kernel device driver to map that vma.

The vma does not need to have any valid CPU mapping so that only
peer to peer device might access its content. Or it could have
valid CPU mapping too in that case it should point to same memory
for consistency.

Note that peer to peer mapping is highly platform and device
dependent and it might not work in all the cases. However we do
expect supports for this to grow on more hardware platform.

This patch only adds new call backs to vm_operations_struct bulk
of code light within common bus driver (like pci) and device
driver (both the exporting and importing device).

Current design mandate that the importer must obey mmu_notifier
and invalidate any peer to peer mapping anytime a notification
of invalidation happens for a range that have been peer to peer
mapped. This allows exporter device to easily invalidate mapping
for any importer device.
