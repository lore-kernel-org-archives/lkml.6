I remember it's coupled between two LDOs, to provide enough power.

Yes.

The answer is just not to keep this compatibility, as it's not
supported option to update DT without updating kernel.

P.S. I think the DT will update twice on the kernel side, the
first time keep reg_vcc3v3 (as it's coupled) but use real
regulator for reg_vcc1v8, the second time use the real
coupled regulator for reg_vcc3v3.

It's not a good choice.

It's not a reason to keep it back.
