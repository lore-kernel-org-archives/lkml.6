OK that does in fact seem to be the case.  That's good.

Yes that gets too messy.

But delalloc is the default for ext4, so a filesystem mounted with
nodelalloc ought to show that in /proc/mounts as far as I am concerned.
The comment in the code says anything that is different than the global
defaults and the filesystem defaults will be shown, but in this case it
is not.  Maybe the comment is just wrong or unclear and this is actually
the intended behaviour.  I don't think I like the behaviour if it is
intended to work this way.  The /proc/fs/ext4/ option at least looks
workable.  Strangely I found the function that implements it but couldn't
find anything using it for some reason.  I must have just missed it
since it obviously is there.
