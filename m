From the discussion above, the use case is for megaraid_sas. And one of the
two interrupt sets(managed and non-managed) will be chosen according to
workloads runtime.

Each interrupt set actually defines one blk-mq queue mapping, and the
queue mapping needs to respect the rule I mentioned now. However,
non-managed affinity can be changed to any way anytime by user-space.

Recently HPSA tried to add one module parameter to use non-managed
IRQ[1].

Also NVMe RDMA uses non-managed interrupts, and at least one CPU hotplug
issue is never fixed yet[2].
