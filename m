The reason Marc dropped this patch from the series it was first introduced
in was because we didn't have the aim 100% understood. We want the
mitigation by default, but also to have the least chance of migration
failure, and when we must fail (because we're not doing the
straightforward approach listed above, which would prevent failures), then
we want to fail with the least amount of damage to the user.

I experimented with a couple different approaches and provided tables[1]
with my results. I even recommended an approach, but I may have changed
my mind after reading Marc's follow-up[2]. The thread continues from
there as well with follow-ups from Christoffer, Marc, and myself. Anyway,
Marc did this repost for us to debate it and work out the best approach
here.

Thanks,
