FWIW: I provided some patches in the bugzilla, which were reported to
solve the problem. But I looking for confirmation if both are needed:

0001-mt76x02u-use-usb_bulk_msg-to-upload-firmware.patch
0002-mt76usb-do-not-use-compound-head-page-for-SG-I-O.patch

Or problem can be solved by just one of it (either first or second).

Additionally I'm not 100% sure if

0002-mt76usb-do-not-use-compound-head-page-for-SG-I-O.patch

is correct. So perhaps some IOMMU maintainer could look at it.

Lorenzo, what you mean by 'bisecting' here ? Someone did 'git bisect'
on this issue?

Even if that true that AMD IOMMU does not support 'well' SG (what I think
is not true) disabling SG in mt76 driver is not right solution. Right
solution would be propagate the issue to AMD IOMMU maintainers
(already CCed).

One problem in mt76 is page_frag_alloc() usage with different sizes.
page_frag_alloc() unlike like other allocators do not assure alignment
and relay on callers to provide buffers sizes that are aligned.
Unaligned buffer might then not be appropriate for DMA.

Another issue is that dma_map_sg() & dma_map_page() may require some 
constraints. I'm not sure about that and I want to clarify that with 
CCed mm maintainers. I think DMA drivers may expect sg->offset < PAGE_SIZE
for both dma_map_sg() and dma_map_page(). Additionally dma_map_page()
maight expect that offset & length specify buffer within one page.
