That makes no sense to me. Shrinkers are per-sb, so they only
shrink per-filesystem dentries and inodes. If your memcgs are on
different filesystems, then they'll behave according to the size of
that filesystem's caches, not the cache of some other filesystem.

Do we really care which memcg does the global reclaim work as long
as it all gets done in a timely manner? The fact is that when there
is global memory pressure, shrinkers from every memcg will be doing
work all the time and so it really does not matter which shrinker
context does what work. In such cases, memory reclaim is all about
bulk throughput, and we trade of instantenous fairness for overall
fairness and higher bulk throughput.

And, well, the bulk of XFS inode reclaim is not done by the shrinker
contexts - memcg or otherwise - it's done by an asycnhronous,
non-blocking per-filesystem background work which is kicked by a
shrinker scan being run on that filesystem . The only reason we keep
the shrinkers doing direct work is to throttle direct reclaim to the
overall background inode reclaim rate. It's hardly fair for the
filesystem to automatically do the work the memcg should be doing
and doing it faster than the memcg reclaim can do it, is it?

FWIW, inodes are RCU objects, so they aren't freed until RCU grace
periods expire and that means memcg reclaim does not actually free
inodes immediately. They are always delayed to some time after the
memcg shrinker has run and reported it freed those objects.  IOWs,
it really doesn't matter which memcg context does the "freeing"
work, because the freeing of inode memory in any given memcg
actually occurs some time later from callbacks run in a global,
non-memcg aware context....

If there is only one memcg that is generating internal memory
pressure, then only that memcg will be running the shrinker and
reclaiming dentries, inodes and XFS inodes from that memcg. Nothing
else will be running reclaim and hence only the memcg shrinker will
be doing reclaim work. I don't see where you get the "rest of the
system is responsible for it's shrinking" from - that just isn't the
way the shrinker infrastructure works, regardless of whether XFS is
involved or not.

First rule of shrinkers: Shrinkers *aren't easy to understand.*
Second rule of shrinkers: See the first rule.

Cheers,

Dave.
