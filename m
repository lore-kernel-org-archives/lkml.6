It's really more should the clocksource, clockevents and primary
interrupt controller be drivers. Let's get agreement on that first. If
yes, then it probably does make sense that their dependencies are
drivers too. If not, then making only the dependencies drivers doesn't
seem right to me.

I agree those should be separate entities at least. But for a given
h/w block, if you already have to use OF_DECLARE, why would you try to
split that into OF_DECLARE and a driver? what advantage does putting
non-boot essential clocks in a driver or transitioning to a driver get
you?

And I've seen PMIC clocks could be inputs to the SoC's clock
controller(s), so the dependencies get more complicated. Then does the
PMIC driver and its dependencies need to be early drivers too?

But those are drivers of types other than a clock controller that
happen to register some clocks as well. I wasn't saying these cases
can't or shouldn't be part of the driver model. Look at irqchips. We
have some that use the driver model (e.g. every GPIO driver) and some
that don't because there's no need (e.g. GIC).

Doing things earlier is not the only way to solve the problems.
Perhaps we need to figure out how to start things later. Maybe it's
not feasible here, I don't know.

And in those cases, I completely agree they should be part of a driver.
