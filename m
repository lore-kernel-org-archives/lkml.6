Yes, but just to clarify:  the placement of the device page and the way
to communicate the location of the device page address and any other
information needed by the guest-backend are hardware-specific so there
is no generic vop-host-backend implementation which can talk to both a
MIC and to something else.

I don't think the vop framework itself has any such requirement.

The MIC uses it in this way (see Documentation/mic/mic_overview.txt) and
it also makes sense (to me, at least) if one wants to treat the endpoint
like one would treat a virtualized guest.

Correct, this is my understanding also.

Yes.  For example, the guest mounts a 9p filesystem with virtio-9p and
the 9p server is implemented in a userspace process on the host.  This
is again similar to virtualization.

Yes.
