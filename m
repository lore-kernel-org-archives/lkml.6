A side note since I'm not sure I wrote this down in my previous email:
I want ioctl_fsfreeze() directly use freeze_super_excl().

Now to your freeze in progress question: freeze_super_excl() can
immediately return EBUSY when there's freezing in progress. OTOH
freeze_super() always has to wait for the current freeze / thaw to finish
and then do what's necessary. I don't see a use case where you'd like to
have freeze_super() not wait.

You're now speaking about steps to transition to the new API, right? I'd
structure the transition as follows:

1) Move bdev->bd_fsfreeze_count to a superblock.
2) Make freeze_super() grab the counter as well, thaw_super() drops it and
  unfreezes the filesystem only if the counter dropped to zero.
3) Rename freeze_super() to freeze_super_excl().
4) Only now I'd go for messing with freeze_bdev() as it now combines sanely
with freeze_super_excl(). Probably I'd just implement new freeze_super()
with the desired semantics (including waiting for ongoing operation to
finish).
5) And then switch all users (there are 4 in the kernel) from freeze_bdev()
to freeze_super() with the justification in each case why the new semantics
is actually desirable.
6) Drop old freeze_bdev() - note that only one freeze_bdev() user (in
drivers/md/dm.c) is actually interested in passing bdev, all the others are
better off just passing in superblock to new freeze_super(). Anyway for
that user in dm we might still provide a convenience wrapper to grab the
superblock and call new freeze_super() on it.
