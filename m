Cool :)

Yes I think that's the voltage we get battery empty interrupt
and cpcap_battery_irq_thread() calls orderly_poweroff() shuts down
the device.

The 3.3V case was for a different device, so the minimum level
can board specific and less than what the battery thinks it
might be.

No need to do anything except notify user at the battery
low interrupt CPCAP_BATTERY_IRQ_ACTION_BATTERY_LOW :)

That should be based on the PMIC register values that Android
uses. Worth rechecking for sure, I thought it is higher than
normal too for the charge voltage.
