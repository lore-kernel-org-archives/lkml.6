I thought this was the whole point of HMM... And eventually it would
support being able to map the pages through the BAR in cooperation with
the driver. If not, what's that whole layer for? Why not just have HMM
handle this situation?

And what struct pages are actually going to be backing these VMAs if
it's not using HMM?

But mapping is an operation of the memory/struct pages behind the VMA;
not of the VMA itself and I think that's evident by the code in that the
only way the VMA layer is involved is the fact that you're abusing
vm_ops by adding new ops there and calling it by other layers.
