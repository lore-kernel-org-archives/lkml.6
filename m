No it just calls cpcap_battery_cc_get_avg_current() that calculates
the average from last time it got sampled based on number of samples
collected between the two reads. Seems to match what I see on my
power supply here.

Not sure what the max time range is for the PMIC, but yeah I'd
assume once a minute is duoable. Maybe compare it to the chart
you already have?

Yeah right, that can be added later on if needed if you just
plan accordingly. It's replaceable with a T5 after you peel off the
sticker from the corners :)
