IMHO you're making a big deal out of something that should not be.
If the dm bits are that sensitive and cache line honed to perfection
already due to previous regressions in that area, then it might
not be a bad idea to have some compile checks for false cacheline
sharing between sensitive members, or spilling of a sub-struct
into multiple cachelines.

It's not like this was pushed behind your back. It's posted for
review. It's quite possible the net change is a win for dm. Let's
focus on getting it reviewed, rather than pontificate on what
could potentially go all wrong with this.
