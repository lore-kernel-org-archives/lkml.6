It not a bad assumption either -- I happen to be one a very odd
maintainer because I have not been actively contributing for years so
I missed the -next implementation, so it is fine, I don't blame anyone
for my mistake; still a few lines would be fine: who is the
maintainer, where to send the patches, who should be Cc'd, etc. :-)

Hm... I agree that patches (i.e. referring to the email workflow) are
a pain, but I am not sure why the actual "patches" (i.e. referring to
the commits/diffs) need to be harder to work with. Maybe we don't have
the tools for that yet. For instance, the new git range-diff command
is actually quite good to compare versions of series after rebasing.

Yeah, I actually got the correction myself :-) I understand Linus'
reasons about the benefits of using the merges (and I agree that
information shouldn't be dropped); but I think there has to be a
better way to handle conflicts. (See below).

I agree with that being a problem for huge changes and/or developed in
parallel. Still, if we have -next (which is meant precisely to test
integration), we should not have to reduce nor split the amount of
work on the trees just to solve integration in most cases, no? That is
my point. (See again below).

I see this tension as a missing piece of the puzzle. I am not an
expert on the kernel, but I worked in the past on a system similar to
what Stephen is doing: merging many quasi-independent trees at CERN
(but it was not Git in that case, but CVS; yeah... :-).

The problem we had there was similar: 1000+ projects with changes
depending on each other in many, many cases. We had a "release
manager" (similar to what Stephen is doing) sorting it all out in time
to make the release required for the CMS detector -- they suffered a
lot...

We ended up designing a system to make cross-project changes called
"tagsets" (equivalent to the Next/* files included in linux-next). I
also added support for assigning dependencies to other pending (or
done) tagsets in a graph. Cycles in the graph meant changes had to go
in at the same time. The dependencies were plotted in an SVG graph
drawn by Graphviz. All this in a webapp to make it convenient for
remote developers and release managers. Fun times :-)

This served as a transition step from CVS to Git (and nowadays I think
everything is done with standard PRs in GitHub AFAIK). However, it
seems we are having the same problem. Although it is much easier to
handle (less trees, git rerere, better tooling, etc.), Stephen still
has a custom system to deal with all the trees, so it seems there *is*
something missing. (...continuing below using the example)

(...from above) Yes, indeed, but the point is that changes should be
able to be done in different parts of the kernel crossing trees and
decided by everyone.

We have this problem only because we have ended up dividing the kernel
in so many almost-independent trees (and mailing lists) that, in the
end, it is like having several independent projects; which then in
turn requires a custom system to sort out everything again (which is
the same problem we faced at CMS).

So either a) we are missing a system to actually handle this kind of
mega-project composed of smaller projects (like Stephen's, or the
already-retired one at CMS); or b) we are missing way to discuss
changes globally that scales (so that splitting trees is not required
and the problem goes away).

Just to be clear, I don't have a magical solution for this :-) I am
just saying that it looks very, very familiar to me and that, if we
had that something, those problems about wasting time debugging
changes made to different trees shouldn't be there; and therefore we
wouldn't need to drop patches, leave dead code for defensive reasons,
rejecting work, creating technical debt, etc.

Maybe the "solution" should be a new webapp to sort out kernel
development better. Maybe it should be a better discussion platform
other than email. Maybe it should be some Git support for managing
many dependent "subtrees" with possible dependencies, preparing
"releases", doing "super-merges" of all trees when ready (e.g. merge
window) -- basically linux-next and Stephen's scripts, but kept in the
repository itself; so that Linus could simply "trigger" the full merge
on the merge window, etc.

Yes, of course your change was tested, and that is a good thing. My
point is simply that it is still misleading, and it is still better to
simply do it kernel-wide if possible (which goes back to: we currently
have effectively independent projects going on). The change would have
been tested by you the same way if it had been applied kernel-wide.

Cheers,
Miguel
