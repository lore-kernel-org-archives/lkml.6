I didn't mean the freezer cgroup, suspend can fail, it does the "global" freeze.
Nevermind.

Hmm. I meant that we should use a single wait_for_completion_interruptible().

Yes. Should we undo the mount if the tracee is killed?

Yes. But note that we know that if the same tracee sends another notification
it must be the same syscall.

So. If the listener needs to undo mount when the tracee is killed, it should
undo it if it was interrupted too.

If no, the listener can simply "ignore" the next notification and do
SECCOMP_IOCTL_NOTIF_SEND(val = 0, error = 0).

I see no real difference...

Yes, but this returns us to my my question: Is it that important?

What exactly the listener can do if it gets SECCOMP_NOTIF_FLAG_SIGNALED?

Undo the mount? No. This doesn't differ from the case when the tracee gets
the non-fatal signal right after SECCOMP_NOTIFY_REPLIED.

Oleg.
