So, non-explicit list will match current "security=3D" behavior which users
are more familiar with. The current answer for this question is "because
your distro enabled it and you didn't disabled it. With non-explcit list
that answer will stay the same.

With explicit list, the question will be "why is yama disabled when I
enabled AppArmor with lsm=3Dapparmor".

To ask both questions user have to know that something like "yama" exist
in first place.

As for question what users typically want you may look at search results
for "disable/enable yama" and "disable/enable apparmor/selinux". The
difference is several orders of magnitude. That's why I think typical user
just want to switch on/off one major lsm. I don't think anecdotal evidence
is representative here.

"it should only requires they know the set that they want" is very
hard requirement and I don't think most users will pass this.
Especially when sets like:

lsm=3Dyama,loadpin,integrity,apparmor
lsm=3Dloadpin,integrity,yama,apparmor

will behave differently.
