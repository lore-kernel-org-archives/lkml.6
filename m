My point was its more nuanced than this: the ARM-ARM's
TakeVirtualSErrorException() pseudo-code lets virtual-SError have an
implementation defined syndrome. I've never seen Juno generate anything other
than '0', but it might do something different on a thursday.

The point? We can't know what a CPU without the RAS extensions puts in there.

Why Does this matter? When migrating a pending SError we have to know the
difference between 'use this 64bit value', and 'the CPU will generate it'.
If I make an SError pending with ESR=0 on a CPU with VSESR, I can't migrated to
a system that generates an impdef SError-ESR, because I can't know it will be 0.

It's two types of v8.0 CPU, no RAS extensions.

I agree, this means we need to be able to tell the difference between 'pending'
and 'pending with this ESR'.

Great!


Thanks,
