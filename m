In a very cryptic way that requires manual parsing using non-public
docs sadly but yes. From the look of it, it's a completion timeout.

Looks to me like we don't get a response to a config space access
during the change of D state. I don't know if it's the write of the D3
state itself or the read back though (it's probably detected on the
read back or a subsequent read, but that doesn't tell me which specific
one failed).

Some extra logging in OPAL might help pin that down by checking the InA
error state in the config accessor after the config write (and polling
on it for a while as from a CPU perspective I don't knw if the write is
synchronous, probably not).

Cheers,
Ben.
