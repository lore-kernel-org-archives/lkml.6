The robust list of the failing task seems to be correct.

The only reason why it would abort is due a page fault because that cannot
be handled in the exit code anymore.

The glibc code does:

       THREAD_SETMEM (THREAD_SELF, robust_head.list_op_pending,
       		     (void *) (((uintptr_t) &mutex->__data.__list.__next)
                                   | 1));

       ....
       lock in user space

       or

       lock in kernel space

       ENQUEUE_MUTEX_PI (mutex);
       THREAD_SETMEM (THREAD_SELF, robust_head.list_op_pending, NULL);

       ENQUEUE_MUTEX_PI() resolves to a THREAD_GETMEM() which reads the
       list head from TLS, some list manipulation operations and the final
       THREAD_SETMEM() which stores the new list head

Now on x86 THREAD_GETMEM() and THREAD_SETMEM() are resolving to

    asm volatile ("movX .....")

on s390 they are

   descr->member

based operations.

Now the important part of the robust list is the store sequence, i.e. the
list head and final update to the TLS visible part need to come _before_
list_op_pending is cleared.

I might be missing something, but there is no compiler barrier in that code
which would prevent the compiler from reordering the stores. It can
rightfully do so because there is no compiler visible dependency of these
two operations.

On x8664 the asm volatile might prevent it by chance, but it does not have
a 'memory' specified which would guarantee a compiler barrier.

On s390 there is certainly nothing.

So assumed that clearing list_op_pending comes before the list head update,
then the robust exit code in the kernel will fail to see either of
them. FAIL.

I might be wrong as usual, but this would definitely explain the fail very
well.

Thanks,
