I agree and I thank you for accepting this in core ACPI code, I think
that's much cleaner than a driver specific scan hook.

It is a shame we do not have a generic identifier for such bus in ACPI
but that won't happen overnight anyway (if ever, I think a binding for
LPC in the ACPI specs is hard to justify).

Thank you,
Lorenzo
