Good news, 40 tests (RHEL-7 backport) with clearing out the
STACK_FRAME_MARKER were all successful.  Previously I would see stalled
livepatch transitions due to the unreliable report in ~10% of test
cases.

I gave this about 20 tests and they were also all successful, what do
you think?  (The log could probably use some trimming and cleanup.)  I
think either solution would fix the issue.

Subject: [PATCH] powerpc/livepatch: relax reliable stack tracer exception
 check

The ppc64le reliable stack tracer iterates over a given task's stack,
verifying a set of conditions to determine whether the trace is
'reliable'.  These checks include the presence of any exception frames.

We should be careful when inspecting the bottom-most stack frame (the
first to be unwound), particularly for scheduled-out tasks.  As Nicolai
Stange explains, "If I'm reading the code in _switch() correctly, the
first frame is completely uninitialized except for the pointer back to
the caller's stack frame."  If a previous do_IRQ() invocation, for
example, has left a residual exception-marker on the first frame, the
stack tracer would incorrectly report this task's trace as unreliable.

save_stack_trace_tsk_reliable() already skips the first frame when
verifying the saved Link Register.  It should do the same when looking
for the STACK_FRAME_REGS_MARKER.  The task it is unwinding will be
either 'current', in which case the tracer will have never been called
from an exception path, or the task will be inactive and its first
frame's contents will be uninitialized (aside from backchain pointer).
