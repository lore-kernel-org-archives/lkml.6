Actually moving the logic from 5-bytes to 6-bytes is much more
complicated, that's why I went with this approach before. I don't
think it can be improved much more beyond creating a nop slide in
mrecordcount but that's a different approach. I will clean-up the code
a bit for the next iteration but that's about it. Let me know what you
think.
