There is no "next patch in this series" :(

Please send patches that you know are correct, why would I want to
review this if you know it is not correct?

And if the original commit is causing problems for you, why not just
revert that instead of adding this much-increased complexity?

Why are you wrapping lines that do not need to be wrapped?

What does this function do?

You have a device, use it for debugging, i.e. dev_dbg().

Recursive?

I really do not understand what the above code is supposed to be doing :(

Always run checkpatch.pl on patches so you do not get grumpy maintainers
telling you to run checkpatch.pl :(

What barrier?

I'm stopping here as I have no idea what is going on, and this needs a
lot more work at the basic level of "it handles locking correctly"...

If you are working on this for power9, I'm guessing you work for IBM?
If so, please run this through your internal patch review process before
sending it out again...

thanks,
