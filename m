Yeah, I thought about that, and don't particularly care for it either.  I also
thought about checking the dead flag at the end of send_to_asoc, but that won't
work either, as the caller of wait_for_sndbuf still has a reference.  I think,
for now, you were right the first time, we just need to reposition it.   I'll be
checking the fix with the provided reproducer today.
