I'm not sure what you're talking about. execve() doesn't change the PID
of a process, and in the case we are talking about:

  pidX_handle =3D open_pid_handle(pidX);
  [ pidX execs a setuid binary ]
  do_something(pidX_handle);

pidX still has the same PID (so PID recycling is irrelevant in this
case). The key point is whether do_something() should give you an error
in such a state transition, and in that case I would say you'd get
-EPERM which would indicate (obviously) insufficient privileges.

If the PID has died you'd get -ESRCH. Even if it was eventually
recycled. Because you've pinned a 'struct pid'.

I don't think this is really relevant to what I'm trying to say...

O_PATH. In container runtimes this is necessary for several reasons to
protect against malicious container root filesystems as well as avoiding
exposing a dirfd to the container.

In LXC, O_PATH re-opening is used for /dev/ptmx as well as some other
operations. In runc we use it for FIFO re-opening so that we can signal
pid1 in a container to execve() into user code.

So this isn't a new thing.

The re-opening part was just an argument to show that there isn't a
condition where you wouldn't be able to get access to the 'struct pid'.
I doubt that anyone would actually need to use this -- since you'd need
to pass "/proc/pid/fd/..." to a more privileged process in order to use
the re-opening.

But this also means that we don't need to have a concept of a pidfd that
isn't actually associated with a PID but is instead associated with
current->mm (which is what you appear to be proposing with the whole
"identity fd" concept).

Andy might be arguing for this (and as you said, I can see the benefit
of doing it this way).

I'm not convinced that doing permission checks on-open is necessary here
-- I get Andy's point about write(2) semantics but I think a new set of
proc_* syscalls wouldn't need to follow those semantics. I might be
wrong though.

Again, I think we should agree on whether it's necessary to have both
types of fds before we commit to maintaining both APIs forever...

It is the case if the process is dead in the sense that the PID might be
re-used. That is what I meant be "dead" here, not semi-dead in the sense
that zombies are.

Sure, I'd propose that ptrace_may_access() is what we should use for
operation permission checks.
