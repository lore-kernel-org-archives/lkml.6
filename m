It wasn't that anybody demanded it to be that way, but rather that the
maintainer chose to do it like that, as you can see from the first version
that got posted: https://marc.info/?l=linux-arch&m=142181640803103
This is the only reference point we have, since no other architecture
ever got removed and then put back.

Also, now that the other architectures are gone, a lot of changes can
be done more easily that will be incompatible with a pure revert, so
the more time passes, the harder it will get to do that.

Some of the architectures (e.g. tile or cris) have been kept up to
date, but others had already bitrotted to the point where they were
unlikely to work on any real hardware for many relases, but a revert
could still be used as a starting point in theory.
