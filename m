That's not a problem, since we didn't use that reserved bit in any of images
now, there is no backward compatibility issue.

Alright, we could, but if so, i_advise will run out of space earlier, after that
we have to add real advice bit into i_inline or i_flags, that would be a little
weird.

For encryption bit, as a common vfs feature flag, in the beginning of encryption
development, it will be better to set it into i_flags, IMO, but now, we have to
keep it as it was.

> Moreover, we guarantee i_flags less strictly from power-cut than i_advise.

IMO, in power-cut scenario, it needs to keep both i_flags and i_advise being
recoverable strictly. Any condition that we can not recover i_flags?
