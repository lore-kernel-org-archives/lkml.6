TIF_NOTIFY_RESUME context in the exit slowpath is fine, too.

It's not about security.  The idea is that instruction_pointer_set()
should return some indication of whether it actually set the
instruction pointer to the requested value.  On x86, if you have
!user_64bit_mode(regs) and you call instruction_pointer_set() to set
ip to 0xbaadc0de12345678, then you end up with a state where we will
probably execute user code at the address 0x12345678.  Conversely, if
you have user_64bit_mode(regs) == true and you set ip to
0xbaadc0de12345678, then you will end up sending a signal to the task
because 0xbaadc0de12345678 is not executable (and, in fact, is highly
likely to be noncanonical).

So I would argue that the semantics *should* be:

/*
 * Attempts to modify @regs such that the next user instruction to be
executed is
 * the instruction at @addr.  instruction_pointer_set() may return
false to indicate
 * that addr was invalid in the sense that the next user instruction executed
 * might be some other address instead.  The most likely cause is that
 * regs refers to a 32-bit compat context, addr != (u32)addr, and the
architecture
 * might silently truncate the address on the next return to user code.
 *
 * instruction_pointer_set() must only be called from a context in
which the architecture
 * allows arbitrary modifications of @regs.
 *
 * Architecture implementations promise that calling
instruction_pointer_set() will not
 * crash or otherwise corrupt the kernel when called from a valid
context, regardless
 * of what value is passed in @addr.
 */

Just use the 64-bit values, I think.  I see no point in killing the task.

Agreed.

I would be okay with that, too, but I think it would have to be
user_64bit_mode(task, regs), since
sane architectures would have the task bitness somewhere other than in
regs.  x86 is IMO rather
weird in this regard.  When I added user_64bit_mode(), I didn't
envision its use outside x86 arch code.

is_compat_task() historically literally meant "am I in a compat system
call".  It never worked consistently on x86 outside of syscall
context.  While I do have fundamental objections to having a generic
concept of "is this a compat task?" on Linux, that's not why I removed
is_compat_task().  I removed it because it didn't do what the name
suggested.

Unfortunately, while it's gone from generic code, it's still there on
non-x86 arches, and it probably still has inconsistent semantics.  So
I don't want to re-add it.

But I think that the limited solution of changing
instruction_pointer_set() really is a sufficient
architecture-dependent change to fully solve your problem.
