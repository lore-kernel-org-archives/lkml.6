Sorry for not illustrating the scenario more clearly, here’s the test scenario:
 0) fresh boot
 1) no ethernet cable plugged
 2) e1000e runtime suspend
 3) PME_Status is 0
 4) plug ethernet cable
 5) e1000e gets woken up by ACPI wakeup
 6) network connection established
 6) unplug the ethernet cable
 7) e1000e runtime suspend
 8) plug ethernet cable again
 9) PME_Status=1 but it’s not woken up, stays suspended
 10) Plug a USB device, e1000e wakes up.

This shows somehow the ACPI GPE still works for USB controller but not ethernet device.

I’ll ask them if they can provide an erratum.

Dmesg with the debug patch applied:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/attachment.cgi?id=280819

At the end, I re-plugged the ethernet cable, nothing shows.
