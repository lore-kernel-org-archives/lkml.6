On s390, we have cryptographic coprocessor cards, which are modeled on
Linux as devices on the AP bus. Each card can be partitioned into domains
which can be thought of as a set of hardware registers for processing 
crypto commands. Crypto commands are sent to a specific domain within a
card is via a queue which is identified as a (card,domain) tuple. We model 
this something like the following (assuming we have access to cards 3 and 
4 and domains 1 and 2):

AP -> card3 -> queue (3,1)
            -> queue (3,2)
   -> card4 -> queue (4,1)
            -> queue (4,2)

If we want to virtualize this, we can use a feature provided by the
hardware. We basically attach a satellite control block to our main
hardware virtualization control block and the hardware takes care of
most of the rest.

For this control block, we don't specify explicit tuples, but a list of
cards and a list of domains. The guest will get access to the cross
product.

Because of this, we need to take care that the lists provided to
different guests don't overlap; i.e., we need to enforce sane
configurations. Otherwise, one guest may get access to things like
secret keys for another guest.

The idea of this patch set is to introduce a new device, the matrix
device. This matrix device hangs off a different root and acts as the
parent node for mdev devices.

If you now want to give the tuples (4,1) and (4,2), you need to do the
following:

- Unbind the (4,1) and (4,2) tuples from their ap bus driver.
- Bind the (4,1) and (4,2) tuples to the vfio_ap driver.
- Create the mediated device.
- Assign card 4 and domains 1 and 2 to the mediated device

QEMU will now simply consume the mediated device and things should work.

For a complete description of the architecture and concepts underlying the 
design, see the Documentation/s390/vfio-ap.txt file included with this
patch set.

v4 => v5 Change log:
===================
* Added code to mdev open callback to ensure not more than one vfio-ap
  device can be opened by a guest.
* Interpret AP instructions by default
* Removed patch implementing interface to enable/disable AP interpretation,
  since that will now be done by default
* Removed patch to reset crypto attributes for ALL vcpus. That will be 
  submitted as a single patch since it will not be needed in this series - 
  i.e., it was called from the interface to enable/disable AP instructions
* All code for initializing crypto for a guest has been moved back to 
  kvm-s390.c, kvm_s390_crypto_init(kvm) function
* Maintaining a module reference count for the vfio_ap module so it is not
  removed while a guest with AP devices is running.
* AP bus interfaces needed by KVM that are unavailable if CONFIG_ZCRYPT=n
  are temporarily embedded in KVM until available statically via future 
  patch.
