Um?  There is no "volume string" defined.

What the parenthesis in the comment means is that fsinfo_attr_volume_name
returns a variable-length string rather than a fixed structure - ie. it's type
information.

I would do it like that.  Note that these things are described in the manual
page that I posted previously.  I'll attach that here (note that it needs
updating).

Ummm...  Not sure.  I feel like they should, but they can also go in
FSINFO_ATTR_PARAMETER if they're already described by a mount parameter.

I was thinking more of bcachefs where the "source" parameter to mount(2) looks
something like "/dev/sda1:/dev/sda2".

One of the important considerations for setting up the parser is that we still
have to handle mount(2) for existing filesystems.

I was planning on requiring them to be added here and also listed in:

	static const u16 fsinfo_buffer_sizes[FSINFO_ATTR__NR] = {
		FSINFO_STRUCT		(STATFS,		statfs),
		FSINFO_STRUCT		(FSINFO,		fsinfo),
		...
	};

in fs/statfs.c.

I've fixed that, thanks.

Is that possible with any of our current interfaces?

It's something I can add, but I can imagine circumstances where the inode
number space has holes in it that can't be allocated (say inode numbers
correspond to particular blocks on disk).  I wonder if that's something I need
worry about.

Btw, note that the fsinfo() interface is constructed such that it's practical
to expand any particular struct in the future, provided any new fields are
tagged on the end and don't mind defaulting to 0.  fsinfo() returns just the
data you asked for, truncating the returned data to fit your request.  If you
ask for more than it has, then it clears the excess space (hence the
defaulting to 0 condition above).

That needs more discussion, I think, particularly involving Dave Chinner.

If you really want.  4GiB alignment and granularity is a bit insane, though.

.TH FSINFO 2 2018-06-06 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
fsinfo \- Get filesystem information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <sys/types.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/fsinfo.h>
.br
.B #include <unistd.h>
.br
.BR "#include <fcntl.h>           " "/* Definition of AT_* constants */"
.PP
.BI "int fsinfo(int " dirfd ", const char *" pathname ","
.BI "           struct fsinfo_params *" params ","
.BI "           void *" buffer ", size_t " buf_size );
.fi
.PP
.IR Note :
There is no glibc wrapper for
.BR fsinfo ();
see NOTES.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
fsinfo() retrieves the desired filesystem attribute, as selected by the
parameters pointed to by
.IR params ,
and stores its value in the buffer pointed to by
.IR buffer .
.PP
The parameter structure is optional, defaulting to all the parameters being 0
if the pointer is NULL.  The structure looks like the following:
.PP
.in +4n
.nf
struct fsinfo_params {
    __u32 at_flags;     /* AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW and similar flags */
    __u32 request;      /* Requested attribute */
    __u32 Nth;          /* Instance of attribute */
    __u32 Mth;          /* Subinstance of Nth instance */
    __u32 __reserved[6]; /* Reserved params; all must be 0 */
};
.fi
.in
.PP
The filesystem to be queried is looked up using a combination of
.IR dfd ", " pathname " and " params->at_flags.
This is discussed in more detail below.
.PP
The desired attribute is indicated by
.IR params->request .
If
.I params
is NULL, this will default to
.BR fsinfo_attr_statfs ,
which retrieves some of the information returned by
.BR statfs ().
The available attributes are described below in the "THE ATTRIBUTES" section.
.PP
Some attributes can have multiple values and some can even have multiple
instances with multiple values.  For example, a network filesystem might use
multiple servers.  The names of each of these servers can be retrieved by
using
.I params->Nth
to iterate through all the instances until error
.B ENODATA
occurs, indicating the end of the list.  Further, each server might have
multiple addresses available; these can be enumerated using
.I params->Nth
to iterate the servers and
.I params->Mth
to iterate the addresses of the Nth server.
.PP
The amount of data written into the buffer depends on the attribute selected.
Some attributes return variable-length strings and some return fixed-size
structures.  If either
.IR buffer " is  NULL  or " buf_size " is 0"
then the size of the attribute value will be returned and nothing will be
written into the buffer.
.PP
The
.I params->__reserved
parameters must all be 0.
.\"_______________________________________________________
.SS
Allowance for Future Attribute Expansion
.PP
To allow for the future expansion and addition of fields to any fixed-size
structure attribute,
.BR fsinfo ()
makes the following guarantees:
.RS 4m
.IP (1) 4m
It will always clear any excess space in the buffer.
.IP (2) 4m
It will always return the actual size of the data.
.IP (3) 4m
It will truncate the data to fit it into the buffer rather than giving an
error.
.IP (4) 4m
Any new version of a structure will incorporate all the fields from the old
version at same offsets.
.RE
.PP
So, for example, if the caller is running on an older version of the kernel
with an older, smaller version of the structure than was asked for, the kernel
will write the smaller version into the buffer and will clear the remainder of
the buffer to make sure any additional fields are set to 0.  The function will
return the actual size of the data.
.PP
On the other hand, if the caller is running on a newer version of the kernel
with a newer version of the structure that is larger than the buffer, the write
to the buffer will be truncated to fit as necessary and the actual size of the
data will be returned.
.PP
Note that this doesn't apply to variable-length string attributes.

.\"_______________________________________________________
.SS
Invoking \fBfsinfo\fR():
.PP
To access a file's status, no permissions are required on the file itself, but
in the case of
.BR fsinfo ()
with a path, execute (search) permission is required on all of the directories
in
.I pathname
that lead to the file.
.PP
.BR fsinfo ()
uses
.IR pathname ", " dirfd " and " params->at_flags
to locate the target file in one of a variety of ways:
.TP
[*] By absolute path.
.I pathname
points to an absolute path and
.I dirfd
is ignored.  The file is looked up by name, starting from the root of the
filesystem as seen by the calling process.
.TP
[*] By cwd-relative path.
.I pathname
points to a relative path and
.IR dirfd " is " AT_FDCWD .
The file is looked up by name, starting from the current working directory.
.TP
[*] By dir-relative path.
.I pathname
points to relative path and
.I dirfd
indicates a file descriptor pointing to a directory.  The file is looked up by
name, starting from the directory specified by
.IR dirfd .
.TP
[*] By file descriptor.
.IR pathname " is " NULL " and " dirfd
indicates a file descriptor.  The file attached to the file descriptor is
queried directly.  The file descriptor may point to any type of file, not just
a directory.
.PP
.I flags
can be used to influence a path-based lookup.  A value for
.I flags
is constructed by OR'ing together zero or more of the following constants:
.TP
.BR AT_EMPTY_PATH
.\" commit 65cfc6722361570bfe255698d9cd4dccaf47570d
If
.I pathname
is an empty string, operate on the file referred to by
.IR dirfd
(which may have been obtained using the
.BR open (2)
.B O_PATH
flag).
If
.I dirfd
is
.BR AT_FDCWD ,
the call operates on the current working directory.
In this case,
.I dirfd
can refer to any type of file, not just a directory.
This flag is Linux-specific; define
.B _GNU_SOURCE
.\" Before glibc 2.16, defining _ATFILE_SOURCE sufficed
to obtain its definition.
.TP
.BR AT_NO_AUTOMOUNT
Don't automount the terminal ("basename") component of
.I pathname
if it is a directory that is an automount point.  This allows the caller to
gather attributes of the filesystem holding an automount point (rather than
the filesystem it would mount).  This flag can be used in tools that scan
directories to prevent mass-automounting of a directory of automount points.
The
.B AT_NO_AUTOMOUNT
flag has no effect if the mount point has already been mounted over.
This flag is Linux-specific; define
.B _GNU_SOURCE
.\" Before glibc 2.16, defining _ATFILE_SOURCE sufficed
to obtain its definition.
.TP
.B AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW
If
.I pathname
is a symbolic link, do not dereference it:
instead return information about the link itself, like
.BR lstat ().

\fBC\fPhange time and \fBM\fPodification time.  Capability bits are defined
that specify whether each of these exist in the filesystem or not.
.IP
Note that the timestamp description may be approximated or inaccurate if the
file is actually remote or is the union of multiple objects.

.\" __________________ fsinfo_attr_volume_id __________________
.TP
.B fsinfo_attr_volume_id
This retrieves the system's superblock volume identifier as a variable-length
string.  This does not necessarily represent a value stored in the medium but
might be constructed on the fly.
.IP
For instance, for a block device this is the block device identifier
(eg. "sdb2"); for AFS this would be the numeric volume identifier.

.\" __________________ fsinfo_attr_volume_uuid __________________
.TP
.B fsinfo_attr_volume_uuid
This retrieves the volume UUID, if there is one, as a little-endian binary
UUID.  This fills in the following structure:
.PP
.RS
.in +4n
.nf
struct fsinfo_volume_uuid {
    __u8 uuid[16];
};
.fi
.in
.RE
.IP

.\" __________________ fsinfo_attr_volume_name __________________
.TP
.B fsinfo_attr_volume_name
This retrieves the filesystem's volume name as a variable-length string.  This
is expected to represent a name stored in the medium.
.IP
For a block device, this might be a label stored in the superblock.  For a
network filesystem, this might be a logical volume name of some sort.

.\" __________________ fsinfo_attr_cell/domain __________________
.PP
.B fsinfo_attr_cell_name
.br
.B fsinfo_attr_domain_name
.br
.IP
These two attributes are variable-length string attributes that may be used to
obtain information about network filesystems.  An AFS volume, for instance,
belongs to a named cell.  CIFS shares may belong to a domain.

.\" __________________ fsinfo_attr_realm_name __________________
.TP
.B fsinfo_attr_realm_name
This attribute is variable-length string that indicates the Kerberos realm that
a filesystem's authentication tokens should come from.

.\" __________________ fsinfo_attr_server_name __________________
.TP
.B fsinfo_attr_server_name
This attribute is a multiple-value attribute that lists the names of the
servers that are backing a network filesystem.  Each value is a variable-length
string.  The values are enumerated by calling
.BR fsinfo ()
multiple times, incrementing
.I params->Nth
each time until an ENODATA error occurs, thereby indicating the end of the
list.

.\" __________________ fsinfo_attr_server_address __________________
.TP
.B fsinfo_attr_server_address
This attribute is a multiple-instance, multiple-value attribute that lists the
addresses of the servers that are backing a network filesystem.  Each value is
a structure of the following type:
.PP
.RS
.in +4n
.nf
struct fsinfo_server_address {
    struct __kernel_sockaddr_storage address;
};
.fi
.in
.RE
.IP
Where the address may be AF_INET, AF_INET6, AF_RXRPC or any other type as
appropriate to the filesystem.
.IP
The values are enumerated by calling
.IR fsinfo ()
multiple times, incrementing
.I params->Nth
to step through the servers and
.I params->Mth
to step through the addresses of the Nth server each time until ENODATA errors
occur, thereby indicating either the end of a server's address list or the end
of the server list.
.IP
Barring the server list changing whilst being accessed, it is expected that the
.I params->Nth
will correspond to
.I params->Nth
for
.BR fsinfo_attr_server_name .

.\" __________________ fsinfo_attr_parameter __________________
.TP
.B fsinfo_attr_parameter
This attribute is a multiple-value attribute that lists the values of the mount
parameters for a filesystem as variable-length strings.
.IP
The parameters are enumerated by calling
.BR fsinfo ()
multiple times, incrementing
.I params->Nth
to step through them until error ENODATA is given.
.IP
Parameter strings are presented in a form akin to the way they're passed to the
context created by the
.BR fsopen ()
system call.  For example, straight text parameters will be rendered as
something like:
.PP
.RS
.in +4n
.nf

.RE
.IP
Where the initial "word" indicates the option form.

.\" __________________ fsinfo_attr_source __________________
.TP
.B fsinfo_attr_source
This attribute is a multiple-value attribute that lists the mount sources for a
filesystem as variable-length strings.  Normally only one source will be
available, but the possibility of having more than one is allowed for.
.IP
The sources are enumerated by calling
.BR fsinfo ()
multiple times, incrementing
.I params->Nth
to step through them until error ENODATA is given.
.IP
Source strings are presented in a form akin to the way they're passed to the
context created by the
.BR fsopen ()
system call.  For example, they will be rendered as something like:
.PP
.RS
.in +4n
.nf
"s /dev/sda1"
"s example.com/pub/linux/"
.fi
.in
.RE
.IP
Where the initial "word" indicates the option form.

.\" __________________ fsinfo_attr_name_encoding __________________
.TP
.B fsinfo_attr_name_encoding
This attribute is variable-length string that indicates the filename encoding
used by the filesystem.  The default is "utf8".  Note that this may indicate a
non-8-bit encoding if that's what the underlying filesystem actually supports.

.\" __________________ fsinfo_attr_name_codepage __________________
.TP
.B fsinfo_attr_name_codepage
This attribute is variable-length string that indicates the codepage used to
translate filenames from the filesystem to the system if this is applicable to
the filesystem.

.\" __________________ fsinfo_attr_io_size __________________
.TP
.B fsinfo_attr_io_size
This retrieves information about the I/O sizes supported by the filesystem.
The following structure is filled in:
.PP
.RS
.in +4n
.nf
struct fsinfo_io_size {
    __u32 block_size;
    __u32 max_single_read_size;
    __u32 max_single_write_size;
    __u32 best_read_size;
    __u32 best_write_size;
};
.fi
.in
.RE
.IP
Where
.I block_size
indicates the fundamental I/O block size of the filesystem as something
O_DIRECT read/write sizes must be a multiple of;
.IR max_single_write_size " and " max_single_write_size
indicate the maximum sizes for individual unbuffered data transfer operations;
and
.IR best_read_size " and " best_write_size
indicate the recommended I/O sizes.
.IP
Note that any of these may be zero if inapplicable or indeterminable.
