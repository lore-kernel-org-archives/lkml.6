Ok, so I've a few questions about this:

1) You want me to add a:

int firmware_request_with_system_firmware_fallback(struct device *device, const char *name);

function? Note I've deliberately named it with_system_firmware_fallback
and not with_efi_fallback to have the name be platform agnostic in
case we want something similar on other platforms in the future.

And then have this pass a new FW_OPT_SYS_FW_FALLBACK flag to
_request_firmware(), right ?

2) Should this flag then be checked inside _request_firmware() before it
calls fw_get_efi_embedded_fw() (which may be an empty stub), or
inside fw_get_efi_embedded_fw()?

3) Also should I then still check device_property_read_bool(dev,
"efi-embedded-firmware") inside fw_get_efi_embedded_fw(), or do you
want to simply always try the fallback if the driver indicates this ?

The reason I'm asking this is because the presence or not of the
firmware inside the system-firmware is a per board thing, not
a per driver thing. But since the firmware is unique per board
anyways it would be fine to skip the "efi-embedded-firmware"
device-prop check. If we're going to have a separate
firmware_request_with_system_firmware_fallback() function for
this then I'm leaning towards dropping the whole check myself.

So are you ok with dropping the device-prop check then ?

4) Since I'm naming the new function
int firmware_request_with_system_firmware_fallback()
I'm thinking that fw_get_efi_embedded_fw() should be renamed
to firmware_fallback_system_firmware() and the EFI based code
will just be the first (and for now only) provider of this
fallback with an empty stub (inline in the .h file) for when
there is no provider defined. Do you agree with renaming
fw_get_efi_embedded_fw() to
firmware_request_with_system_firmware_fallback() ?

(note this is the wrapper which calls efi_get_embedded_fw()
which itself will not be renamed of course).

Regards,

Hans
