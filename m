Subject: [RFC PATCH 00/35] overlayfs: stack file operations
Date: Thu, 12 Apr 2018 17:07:51 +0200

Up till now overlayfs didn't stack regular file operations.  Instead, when
a file was opened on an overlay, the file from one of the underlying layers
would be opened and any file operations performed would directly go to the
underlying file on a real filesystem.

This works well mostly, but various hacks were added to the VFS to work
around issues with this:

 - d_path() and friends
 - relatime handling
 - file locking
 - fsnotify
 - writecount handling

There are also issues that are unresolved before this patchset:

 - ioctl's that need write access but can be performed on a O_RDONLY fd
 - ro/rw inconsistency: file on lower layer opened for read-only will
   return stale data on read after copy-up and modification
 - ro/rw inconsistency for mmap: file on lower layer mapped shared will
   contain stale data after copy-up and modification

This patch series reverts the VFS hacks (with the exception of d_path) and
fixes the unresoved issues.  We need to keep d_path related hacks, because
memory maps are still not stacked, yet d_path() should keep working on
vma->vm_file->f_path.

No regressions were observed after running various test suites (xfstests,
ltp, unionmount-testsuite, pjd-fstest).

Performance impact of stacking was found to be minimal.  Memory use for
open overlay files increases by about 256bytes or 12%.
