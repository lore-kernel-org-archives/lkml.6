I'm clearly not an expert, so I might be wrong, but I think a physical
page can be both in the identity mapping and mapped in the vmalloc
space. Now, is there a real risk that both ends are accessed in
parallel thus making different cache entries pointing to the same phys
page dirty, I'm not sure. Or maybe there are other corner case, but
you'll have to ask Russell (or any other ARM expert) to get a clearer
answer.
