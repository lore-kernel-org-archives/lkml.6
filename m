That wouldn't hurt, but I don't see how it would help.
It would still be racy as two chained bios could complete at
the same time, so ->bi_status much change between test and set.

If there was a well defined ordering, then we could easily write to code
ensure the highest priority status wins, but I don't think there is any
such ordering.
Certainly dec_pending() in dm.c already faces the possibility that it will
be called multiple times with different errors, but doesn't consider any
ordering (except relating to BLK_STS_DM_REQUEUE), when assigning a
status code to io->status.

And thanks for the report.
