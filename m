I agree that there is something quite weird about having path resolution
flags in an *open* syscall. The main reason why it's linked to open is
because that's the only way to get O_PATH descriptors (which is what you
would use for most of the extended operations we need -- as well as
reading+writing to files which is what most users would do with this).

And I think O_PATH is another example of an open flag that is just odd
in how it changes the semantics of using open(2).

One of the ideas I pitched in an earlier mail was a hypothetical
resolveat(2) -- which would just be a new way of getting an O_PATH
descriptor. This way, we wouldn't be using up more O_* flag bits with
this feature and we'd be able to play with more radical semantic changes
in the future. I can outline these here if you like, but it's a bit of a
long discussion and I'd prefer not to derail things too much if
resolveat(2) is definitely out of the question.

I also completely agree. I think that we should have a discussion about
the long-term plan of syscall flags because it's starting to get a
little bit crazy:

 * Every "get an fd" syscall has its own brand of O_CLOEXEC. Thankfully,
   many of them use the same value (except for memfd_create(2) and a few
   other examples).
 * AT_* was supposed to be generic across all *at(2) syscalls, but there
   are several cases where this isn't really true anymore.

   * renameat2(2) only supports RENAME_* flags.
   * openat(2) supports only O_* flags.
   * Most AT_* flags have O_* counterparts (or are even more of a mess
	 such as with {AT_SYMLINK_FOLLOW,AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW,O_NOFOLLOW}).
   * statx(2) added AT_STATX_* flags, making AT_* no longer generic.

(Also I just want to mention something I noticed while writing this
patch -- openat(2) violates one of the kernel "golden rules" -- that you
reject unknown flags. openat(2) will silently ignore unknown flag bits.
I'm sure there's a really good reason for this, but it's another flag
oddity that I felt fit here.)
