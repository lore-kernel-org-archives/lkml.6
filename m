Nope, the code is most definitely incomplete - it's sufficient to 
support the system it was originally needed for (i.e. platform devices 
with a single range), but can by no means even pretend to support the 
binding fully. Furthermore, the way that PCI support was later grafted 
into of_dma_configure() was *only* in support of dma-coherent without 
consideration for dma-ranges. Hence the current mess.

The real problem is that FDT machines don't describe the PCI hierarchy 
in DT as proper OF does, so we have this awkward crossing between the DT 
model and the Linux device model where the devices have no DT 
representation and the "parent bus" is a DT leaf node, which cocks up 
the way the current code is expecting to work.
