Either way I think we can happily throw that on the "future cleanup" 
pile right now as it's not directly relevant to the purpose of the 
patch; I'm sure we don't want to make potential backporting even more 
difficult.

Ah, right, the significance of it being the *last* argument hadn't 
clicked indeed. A whole barrage of extra macros just to extract res on 
its own would be rather clunky, so let's just keep the nice streamlined 
(if ever-so-slightly non-obvious) implementation as it is and ignore my 
ramblings.
