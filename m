There are two different approaches to untagging the user pointers that I see:

1. Untag user pointers right after they are passed to the kernel.

While this might be possible for pointers that are passed to syscalls
as arguments (Catalin's "hack"), this leaves user pointers, that are
embedded into for example structs that are passed to the kernel. Since
there's no specification of the interface between user space and the
kernel, different kernel parts handle user pointers differently and I
don't see an easy way to cover them all.

2. Untag user pointers where they are used in the kernel.

Although there's no specification on the interface between the user
space and the kernel, the kernel still has to use one of a few
specific ways to access user data (copy_from_user, etc.). So the idea
here is to add untagging into them. This patchset mostly takes this
approach (with the exception of memory subsystem syscalls).

If there's a better approach, I'm open to suggestions.
