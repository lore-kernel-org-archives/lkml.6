True. But a user is unlikely to know "PAPR" either, and it googles badly.

LoPAPR I guess is better, you can google for it, though I'm not entirely
sure if everything used by this code is actually in LoPAPR, because some
bits of PAPR were ripped out of LoPAPR.

Yeah so I guess it's helpful for someone configuring a kernel with that
in mind.

But if you've bought an IBM branded system the "pseries" name is not
used anywhere AFAIK.
