I think the function might be better named cred_uidgid_cmp to make
it clear that the comparison only cares about the uid and gid values
in the cred.  As  Trond points out all of the values are of kuid_t
and kgid_t so are namespace independent at that point.

It happens that mounts of nfs are still limited to mounter in the
initial user namespace.  While it seems plausible that we could allow
unprivileged users to mount nfs filesystems the auditing of the code
base has not been done to confirm that is safe.  The nfs code base is a
large attack surface so this something that must be done with quite a
bit of caution.

I think the NAT case is something to be concerned about.  However I
believe the same attack is possible with an ordinary UDP or TCP socket
bound for the same server.  So I don't know if we can protect the
server.

In general I believe we should put things on the wire that match
sb->s_user_ns.  Matching the mounter of the filesystem.  Because that
means behavior on the wire is independent of if you are running
in a container or not.  That seems to be the least surprising thing to
do, and would match what a userspace nfs client would do.  But again
that is not an immediate concern.
