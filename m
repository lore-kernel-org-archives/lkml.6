I have an updated lm355x backlight driver almost ready, that uses
an updated binding scheme and exposes the keyboard backlight
using the LED subsystem.

I just noticed, that I missed Rob gave his Acked-by to the binding
already. I will prepare a PATCHv6 with the MFD changes this week.

I suppose people from your hackerspace can help you. It's really
easy to do. Soldering can be avoided btw. You can just use a pair
of scissors to cut a USB -> Micro USB cable and use a knife to remove
isolation. Then screw each of the 4 wires into a terminal strip.
There are USB-TTL adapters available, that have an attached cable.
If you also cut the connector from such a cable and connect it to
the other side of the terminal strip you are done. No soldering
involved ;)

The keyboard backlight and lcd backlight are controlled by LM3552,
that's the driver mentioned above. The other LEDs (status rgb,
shift/capslock, and the android button backlight) are working.
