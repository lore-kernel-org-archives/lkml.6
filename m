I have to admit I'm curious how this will work.  I've heard rumor of
using overlayfs inodes and calling the underlying file system's
inode_operations.  If part of that work removes the danger of overlayfs
inode numbers colliding with xino mode, I'm definitely interested.

I was investigating whether Dave's suggestion of using a vfsmount was
feasible.  When following the audit call graph up, I found
fsnotify_move, called by vfs_rename.  Piping a vfsmount into the vfs_*
operations has historically been rejected by Al (see Apparmor
discussions, among others), and with good reason.  The file system
implementation shouldn't care about where it's mounted.  While piping it
into vfs_rename doesn't seem too invasive, it's called by various file
systems' ->rename callback, so then we're stuck piping vfsmounts into
inode_operations, which is what Al's been wanting to avoid for years.

I'm not sure there's a lot of overlap, but I expect that this will end
up running into the same review feedback that Al gave during the
AppArmor merge: vfsmounts have no business at the lower level and you
can get the same behavior by hooking in at a higher level.  See
security_path_* vs security_inode_* for how that was resolved.

What you're talking about isn't really what we had in mind for the
fs_view.  In our case, it sits between the inode and superblock, which
would be at too low a level for determining whether an inode is under a
certain subtree.  In any event, wouldn't you need a path instead of an
inode to do what you're proposing?
