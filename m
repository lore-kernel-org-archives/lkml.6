With these patches, we are trying to relax the user/kernel ABI so that
tagged pointers can be passed into the kernel. Since this is a new ABI
(or an extension to the existing one), it might be ok to change the libc
so that the top byte is zeroed on specific syscalls before issuing the
SVC.

I agree that it is problematic for HWASan if it only relies on
overriding malloc/free.

malloc() or posix_memalign() are C library implementations and it's the
C library (or overridden functions) setting a tag on the returned
pointers. Since the TBI hardware feature allows memory accesses with a
non-zero tag, we could allow them in the kernel for syscalls performing
such accesses on behalf of the user (e.g. get_user/put_user would not
need to clear the tag).

madvise(), OTOH, does not perform a memory access on behalf of the user,
it's just advising the kernel about a range of virtual addresses. That's
where I think, from an ABI perspective, it doesn't make much sense to
allow tags into the kernel for these syscalls (even if it's simpler from
a user space perspective).

(but I don't have a very strong opinion on this ;))
