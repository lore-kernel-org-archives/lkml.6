Ok, I understand the part about ck610 being incompatible, but I'm
still not sure about the 8xx ones: Do you mean it's impossible to
have one kernel that runs across all of them for some other reason,
or is it something you haven't allowed because you see no use for it?

This is basically the same question as above: For c610, using the fixed
value is sufficient, because it's incompatible with the others. But if you want
to run the same kernel on both ck810 and ck860, then it needs some form
of runtime detection.

On other architectures, the L1_CACHE_BYTES constant is the maximum
possible cache line size, and the cache flush function uses the actual size

Ok. Just make sure that the DT always has this information as well,
so this can be changed in the future when desired, without having to
make incompatible changes to the devicetree binary files.
