Yeah, I'm not supportive of codifying that knoweldge in the kernel.  If we were
to support bi-directional versioning, I would encode it into lksctp-tools rather
than the kernel.

No, I think there are a few others (maybe paddrparams?)

I think the thought was to differentiate between someone passing a legit larger
structure from a newer UAPI, from someone just passing in a massive
inappropriately sized buffer (even if the return on both is the same).

I'm less than excited about making the kernel check an unbounded user space
buffer, thats seems like a potential DOS attack from an unpriviledged user to
me.  I'm also still hung up on the notion that, despite how we do this, this
patch is going into the latest kernel, so it will only work on a kernel that
already understands the most recent set of subscriptions.  It would work if we,
again someday in the future extended this struct, someone built against that
newer UAPI, and then tried to run it on a kernel that had this patch.

FWIW, there is an existing implied method to determine the available
subscription events. sctp_getsockopt_events does clamp the size of the output
buffer, and returns that information in the optlen field via put_user.  An
application that was build against UAPIs from 4.19 could pass in the 4.19
sctp_event_subscribe struct to sctp_getsockopt_events, and read the output
length, whcih would inform the application of the events that the kernel is
capable of reporting, and limit itself to only using those events.  Its not a
perfect solution, but its direct, understandable and portable.
