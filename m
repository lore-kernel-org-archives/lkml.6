It's mostly mentioned in the mailing list thread you linked to, but just
for completeness in this thread:

The OpenRISC GCC port is maintained and regularly updated to newer GCC
versions. It is not, however, upstreamed to the FSF due to a single
missing FSF copyright assignment from a developer who has written large
parts of the initial port. All code which has copyright assignments in
place (binutils, GDB, etc.) has been upstreamed lately.

For GCC, Stafford Horne is actively working on rewriting the parts which
we don't have the FSF copyright assignment for (and unless something
very surprising happens, won't get). [If anyone wants to help, there's
GSoC project for it as well:
https://fossi-foundation.org/gsoc18-ideas#openrisc-gcc-port]

So I'd be very sad if the openrisc port gets dropped from Linux upstream.
