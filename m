Hmm. Can't tell mode and freq here easily. Does it default to i2s /
26000000?

Ok, but then we can just start playback/recording with the call, and
everything should work, no?

But Motorola code seems to do different magic according to modem type,
so things may not be as easy.

                if (pdata->voice_type =3D=3D VOICE_TYPE_STE) {
                        /* STE_M570 */
                        ret =3D cpcap_audio_reg_write(codec, 2, 0xAE06);
                        if (rate =3D=3D 16000)
				ret |=3D cpcap_audio_reg_write(codec, 1, 0x8720);
                        else
                                ret |=3D cpcap_audio_reg_write(codec, 1, 0x=
8120);
                } else if (pdata->voice_type =3D=3D VOICE_TYPE_QC) {
                        /* MDM6600 */
                        ret =3D cpcap_audio_reg_write(codec, 2, 0xAE02);
                        if (rate =3D=3D 16000) {
                                ret |=3D cpcap_audio_reg_write(codec, 1, 0x=
6720);
                        } else {
                                ret |=3D cpcap_audio_reg_write(codec, 1, 0x=
6120);
                        }

Ok, another problem seems to be that spaces in audio device name seem
to confuse the userland.

Aha, here:

user@devuan:~$ cat /proc/asound/cards
 0 [H58006000encode]: HDMI_58006000_e - HDMI 58006000.encoder
                       HDMI 58006000.encoder
 1 [Audio          ]: Droid_4_Audio - Droid 4 Audio
                       Droid 4 Audio
		      =20
See how the card is refered simply as "Audio"? Same thing then happens
in alsa "state" file:

state.Audio {
        control.1 {

=2E
