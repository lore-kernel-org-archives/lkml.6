And I forgot to mention that the scsi_debug driver has had an implementation
of the SCSI XDWRITEREAD(10) command with T10 semantics. That is a bidi
command and facilitates testing of SCSI bidi from other block/SCSI
drivers and user space programs. It has been there for over 4 years with
no problems reported. As mentioned above it can be exercised with the
sg_raw utility in the sg3_utils package via a bsg device.
