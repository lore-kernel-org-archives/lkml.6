I meant that the revert commit remove quiet mode support from QCA6174 & 
QCA9377.

Nobody prefers regression :). WCN3990 support was still in progress, at
the time the commit got merged into upstream. My point is that we can't 
expect
the community to validate the changes against in-progress platform.

That is true. Any new features or interface changes in firmware will be
advertised by feature bit. But the quiet param was available in firmware
since first release.

Govind is working on to handle this properly either by instantiating
new WMI-TLV table for WCNxxxx or by adding conditional check in exiting 
path.
