Will fix.

Right but
1. memory is not an optional capability for bridges. All pci bridges
   support memory bridging (unlike e.g. IO).
2. the line below accordingly sets IORESOURCE_MEM unconditionally
   even if devices below the bridge only use IO for now.

So IIUC this really results in bailing out if bridge has already
been configured. Did I miss something?

Well IIUC we need to probe support for optional capabilities such
as IO and 64 bit bridging.
this is what this function does, doesn't it?
