I took a quick look with

  git grep -E "pci_enable_wake\(.*[^0]\);|device_may_wakeup"

and didn't notice any pci_enable_wake() callers that called
device_may_wakeup() first.

Probably a dumb question, but would it make sense to restore the
device_may_wakeup() check in pci_enable_wake(), e.g.,

diff --git a/drivers/pci/pci.c b/drivers/pci/pci.c
index e597655a5643..9fa64c175f92 100644
