There is *dozens* of management systems out there, not even all open
source, we won't ever be able to see the end of the tunnel if we need
to teach every single of them, including end users, about platform
specific new VM flags like that.

There will have to be a new machine type for that I suppose, yes,
though it's not just the hypervisor that needs to know about the
modified migration stream, it's also the need to have a compatible
ultravisor with the right keys on the other side.

So migration is going to be special and require extra admin work in all
cases yes. But not all secure VMs are meant to be migratable.

In any case, back to the problem at hand. What a qemu flag gives us is
just a way to force iommu at VM creation time.

This is rather sub-optimal, we don't really want the iommu in the way,
so it's at best a "workaround", and it's not really solving the real
problem.

As I said replying to Christoph, we are "leaking" into the interface
something here that is really what's the VM is doing to itself, which
is to stash its memory away in an inaccessible place.

Cheers,
Ben.
