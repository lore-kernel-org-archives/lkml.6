See the patch set that Thomas has posted to hopefully resolve these
issues.  I think they are all now taken care of with that series.

Simple up to a point, having loads of different licenses is a mess, as
you are finding out :)

I think you will find more dual-licensed MIT code in the tree already
than ISC, right?

And really, in the end, the odds of someone taking this code _out_ of
the tree and using it only under a non-GPLv2 license is slim, to none,
so it's best to just stick with the common licenses, as long as they
match what you wish the code to abide by.  As you want to follow what
MIT says, then just use that and all should be good, right?
