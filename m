Hi all,

this series of patches adds support to the Cadence PCIe controller.
It was tested on a ARM64 platform emulated by a Palladium running the
pci-next kernel.

The host mode was tested with some PCIe devices connected to the Palladium
through a speed-bridge. Some of those devices were a USB host controller
and a SATA controller. The PCIe host controller was also tested with a
second controller configured in endpoint mode and connected back to back
to the first controller.

The EndPoint Controller (EPC) driver was tested with 2 PCI functions, both
handled by the pci-epf-test driver, using the pcitest userspace program.
I used the "-D" optional command line parameter to select the proper PCI
function.

For linux-pci/master, I applied this series on top of Kishon's patch
("PCI: endpoint: Use EPC's device in dma_alloc_coherent/dma_free_coherent")
otherwise dma_alloc_coherent() fails when called by pci_epf_alloc_space().

Best regards,

Cyrille

ChangeLog

v5 -> v6:
- rebase on linux-pci/master (v4.15-rc4) + Kishon's patch from linux-pci/next:
"PCI: endpoint: Use EPC's device in dma_alloc_coherent()/dma_free_coherent()"
- all patches unchanged

v4 -> v5:
- rebase on today's (20180128) linux-pci/next
- add again the endpoint driver

- Patch 7:
 move host driver from drivers/pci/cadence into drivers/pci/host and remove
 all references to the endpoint mode, as requested by Lorenzo.
 The host driver will be moved back into drivers/pci/cadence by Patch 11

- Patch 8:
 fix comparison of func_no to BAR5: compare to epc->max_functions

- Patch 9:
 add new patch to fix support of PCI multi-function devices

- Patch 10:
 change the 'cdns,max-outbound-regions' from optional to mandatory as requested
 by Kishon.

- Patch 11:
 take Kishon's comments into account as much as I could.

- Other patches: unchanged


v3 -> v4:
- split patch 3 from v3 into patches 3 and 4.
- remove unused cdns_pcie_reset_outbound_region() from old patch 6
  (new patch 7).
- other patches are unchanged.

v2 -> v3:

- rebase on today's linux-pci/next (20180110) 

patch1:
- rework the commit message of patch 1 and add two new comments on why endpoint
  library users must be linked after the endpoint library itself and why
  the dwc rule uses obj-y instead of obj-$(CONFIG_PCIE_CONFIG_DW).
- update patch 1 to add missing ifdef CONFIG_PCI / endif in
  drivers/pci/dwc/Makefile around the obj-$(CONFIG_ARM64) += pcie-hisi.o rule,
  like for the other obj-$(CONFIG_ARM64) rules in drivers/pci/host/Makefile.

patch2: unchanged

patch3:
- update patch 3 so the bridge hooks/members initialization is left to the
  host bridges probe routines.

patch4: unchanged

patch5:
- collect 'Reviewed-by' tag from Rob Herring for the DT bindings.

patch6:
- remove explanation in the commit message on why obj-$(CONFIG_PCIE_CANDENCE) is
  placed after obj-$(CONFIG_PCI_ENDPOINT) in drivers/pci/Makefile since a
  comment on it has been added into patch1.
- remove menuconfig PCI_CADENCE in drivers/pci/cadence/Kconfig to match
  drivers/pci/dwc/Kconfig.
- adapt patch6 to the changes done in patch3 for the pci_host_probe() function.

v1 -> v2:
- add new properties in the device-tree bindings: 'cdns,max-outbound-regions'
  and 'cdns,no-bar-match-nbits'.
- add a new patch to regroup all makefile rules in drivers/pci/Makefile, hence
  cleaning drivers/Makefile up.
- change the license text to use the recommanded format:
  // SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0
- add a new patch updating the API of the EPC library to add support to
  multi-function devices.
- add a 2 new patches to share more common code between host controller drivers
- remove some useless tests
- add more comments in both drivers.
- fix DT bindings examples
- remove useless init of the primary, secondary and sub-ordinate bus numbers in
  the PCI configuration space of the root port.
- remove cdns_pcie_ep_stop() function and rework cdns_pcie_ep_start() function
