I don't think it does, really.

In CAN, if I understand correctly, this is used for regular operation
interfaces, where you might want to run 'tcpdump', on wifi the
equivalent would be 'tcpdump -i wlan0'. This *already* implements full
visibility of outgoing and incoming frames.

Not sure how CAN even manages *not to*, but I don't really need to care
:-)

You're proposing to add this to the *monitor* interfaces and you really
should have made the flag conditional on that to make that clear.

However, even on monitor interfaces, you typically *already* see the
frames you transmitted there (as raw frames, which is the only thing you
can do).

What you're proposing is to use IFF_ECHO to show frames transmitted
through *other* interfaces on the monitor interface.

I don't think the IFF_ECHO semantics really match this.


Additionally, drivers are sort of free to ignore the REQ_TX_STATUS, or
we could in the future add ways of using the _noskb to feed back TX
status to the state machines where needed, so I'm not really sure I even
_want_ this to be set in stone in such an API.

Now, I can also see how this can be useful for debugging, but it feels
to me like this should be a driver (debug) option?
