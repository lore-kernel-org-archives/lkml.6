I am not sure to understand your question.

As there are multiple points in this sentence I will detail each of
them so please comment on the one which is bothering you:
* I am working in parallel on a series adding device links to the clock
  framework. This way when a driver consumes a clock, the clock
  provider driver will be resumed first.
* If the clock series I am talking about is applied after this one,
  there is no build issue. Of course suspending the platform may
  not work but this is a new feature so nothing will be broken.
* Device links do not enforce any priority if the suspend/resume phase
  between two drivers is not the same. The PCIe driver suspends in the
  NOIRQ phase. If we want the clock driver to suspend *after* PCIe, its
  suspend/resume callbacks must be promoted to the NOIRQ phase as well
  (and this is part of another series). As of today there is
  no alternative.


Thanks,
Miquèl
