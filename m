Yes I meant "to check all redistributors were assigned"

Yes we need to, to handle the case where the userspace does not provide
sufficient rdist region space

create 8 vcpus (no iodev registered)
define a redist region for 4 (4 iodevs registered)
start the vcpus

yes indeed.

Well at vgic_init time, vcpus are frozen but dist and redist regions are
not forced to be set, hence the late check we do in map_resources, on
1st VCPU run. Not sure I get this one?
