Probably not, but I'm not going to pick a magic number to gate whats ok and
whats not for sockopt validation.

We really don't have to, I refer you to my previous not referencing the fact
that the getsockopt variant of this call will return the expected length of this
option for the running kernel, allowing userspace to know explicitly what the
buffer size should be, and by extension, what options are supported
