Yes.

But it is a hack against the intention of the scope api. It also alows
maintainers to not care about their broken code.

I agree. But are those existing users broken in the first place? I have
seen so many GFP_NOFS abuses that I would dare to guess that most of
those vmalloc NOFS abusers can be simply turned into GFP_KERNEL. Maybe
that is the reason we haven't heard any complains in years.
