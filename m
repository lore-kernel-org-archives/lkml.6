Yes, the only practical outcome from implementing this is that we can
claim architecture compliance. Would be good if we could do that, but
as long as there are more pressing issues around...

Yes, but it is very confusing as there is also a variable named 'cp' in
this function.

But that's effectively what happens now, no? We reject the orb out of
hand due to unsupported flags that do not have any relevance for the
channel program in that case.

Or maybe 'channel programs using direct addressing only'?

I think it still makes sense if you look at how the functions are
called.

I certainly don't want to dictate things :)

I think it makes it clearer that we already checked earlier in the call
sequence.

Does anybody else have feedback?
