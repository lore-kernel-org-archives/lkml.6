That's a bcache problem, not an XFS problem. XFS does extensive
amounts of metadata readahead (btree traversals, directory access,
etc), and always has.

If bcache considers readahead as "not worth caching" then that has
nothing to do with XFS.

Which is not the case for XFS. We do readahead when we know we are
going to need a block in the near future. It is rarely unnecessary,
it's a mechanism to reduce access latency when we do need to access
the metadata.

File data readahead: REQ_RAHEAD
Metadata readahead: REQ_META | REQ_RAHEAD

drivers/md/bcache/request.c::check_should_bypass():

        /*
         * Flag for bypass if the IO is for read-ahead or background,
         * unless the read-ahead request is for metadata (eg, for gfs2).
         */
        if (bio->bi_opf & (REQ_RAHEAD|REQ_BACKGROUND) &&
            !(bio->bi_opf & REQ_PRIO))
                goto skip;

bcache needs fixing - it thinks REQ_PRIO means metadata IO. That's
wrong - REQ_META means it's metadata IO, and so this is a bcache
bug.

Cheers,

Dave.
