Perhaps I also wasn't clear. With "platform dependency", I meant not just
architectures (e.g. ARM64), but also platform families (e.g. ARCH_EXYNOS).

OK, so the list can be extended when you send the DTS for that...

... and IMHO an initial empty list is fine, as it will still be upstream, and
compile-tested by the bots.

(note: I do love Upstream First(tm)!)

At least those depend on PCI or I2C, and thus won't show up on machines
without PCI or I2C.

My underlying idea is not to cut down build time for test code (that's what
we have COMPILE_TEST for), but to enhance usability for users and distros,
who need to know if it makes sense to enable an option.

IMHO the extensive list of possible architectures is not really an
improvement. So either a dependency on COMPILE_TEST, or no dependency
at all makes the most sense to me.
