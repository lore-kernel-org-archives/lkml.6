Just to be clear: the Coccinelle scripts I'm building aren't doing a
kmalloc -> kvmalloc conversion. I'm just removing all the 2-factor
multiplication and replacing it with the appropriate calls to the
allocator family's *calloc or *alloc_array(). This will get us to the
place where we can do all the sanity-checking in the allocator
functions (whatever that checking ends up being). As it turns out,
though, we have kind of a lot of allocator families. Some are
wrappers, like devm_*alloc(), etc.

All that said, the overwhelming majority of *alloc() multiplications
are just "count * sizeof()". It really feels like everything should
just be using a new *alloc_struct() which can do the type checking,
etc, etc, but we can get there. The remaining "count * size" are a
minority and could be dealt with some other way.

Yeah, bare *alloc_ab_c() is not great. Perhaps a leading "__" can hint to that?

Yup: I'm not after that either. I just want to be able to get at the
multiplication factors before they're multiplied. :)

Agreed. I think most cases are already getting lifted to size_t due to
the sizeof(). It's the "two variables" cases I want to double-check.
Another completely insane idea would be to have a macro that did type
size checking and would DTRT, but with all the alloc families, it
looks nasty. This is all RFC stage, as far as I'm concerned.

Fun example: devm_kzalloc(dev, sizeof(...) * num, gfp...)

$ git grep 'devm_kzalloc([^,]*, *sizeof([^,]*,' | egrep '\* *sizeof|\)
*\*' | wc -l
88

some are constants:
drivers/video/fbdev/au1100fb.c:         devm_kzalloc(&dev->dev,
sizeof(u32) * 16, GFP_KERNEL);

but many aren't:
sound/soc/generic/audio-graph-card.c:   dai_link  = devm_kzalloc(dev,
sizeof(*dai_link)  * num, GFP_KERNEL);

While type-checking on the non-sizeof factor would let us know if it
was safe, so would the division, and most of those could happen at
compile time. It's the size_t variables that we want to catch.

So, mainly I'm just trying to get the arguments reordered (for a
compile-time division) into the correct helpers so the existing logic
can do the right thing, and only for 2-factor products. After that,
then I'm hoping to tackle the multi-factor products, of which the
*alloc_struct() helper seems to cover the vast majority of the
remaining cases.
