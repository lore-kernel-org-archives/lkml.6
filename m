Why do you need them to run in the "noirq" phase in the first place?

This expectation is not in agreement with the documented suspend code flow,
however.

Each phase of it is carried out for *all* devices completely before getting
to the next phase, "prepare" first, then "suspend", "suspend_late" and
"suspend_noirq", in this order.

The rework you seem to be talking about is not possible, I'm afraid.
