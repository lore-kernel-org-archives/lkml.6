Subject: [PATCH v5 5/6] firmware_loader: enhance Kconfig documentation over FW_LOADER

If you try to read FW_LOADER today it speaks of old riddles and
unless you have been following development closely you will loose
track of what is what. Even the documentation for PREVENT_FIRMWARE_BUILD
is a bit fuzzy and how it fits into this big picture.

Give the FW_LOADER kconfig documentation some love with more up to
date developments and recommendations. While at it, wrap the FW_LOADER
code into its own menu to compartamentalize and make it clearer which
components really are part of the FW_LOADER. This should also make
it easier to later move these kconfig entries into the firmware_loader/
directory later.

-	bool
+	bool "Enable the firmware sysfs fallback mechanism"
+	help
+	  This option enables a sysfs loading facility to enable firmware
+	  loading to the kernel through userspace as a fallback mechanism
+	  if and only if the kernel's direct filesystem lookup for the
+	  firmware failed using the different /lib/firmware/ paths, or the
+	  path specified in the firmware_class path module parameter, or the
+	  firmware_class path kernel boot parameter if the firmware_class is
+	  built-in. For details on how to work with the sysfs fallback mechanism
+	  refer to Documentation/driver-api/firmware/fallback-mechanisms.rst.
+
+	  The direct filesystem lookup for firwmare is always used first now.
+
+	  If the kernel's direct filesystem lookup for firware fails to find
+	  the requested firmware a sysfs fallback loading facility is made
+	  available and userspace is informed about this through uevents.
+	  The uevent can be supressed if the driver explicitly requested it,
+	  this is known as the driver using the custom fallback mechanism.
+	  If the custom fallback mechanism is used userspace must always
+	  acknowledge failure to find firmware as the timeout for the fallback
+	  mechanism is disabled, and failed requests will linger forever.
+
+	  This used to be the default firmware loading facility, and udev used
+	  listen for uvents to load firmware for the kernel. The firmware
+	  loading facility functionality in udev has been removed, as such it
+	  can no longer be relied upon as a fallback mechanism. Linux no longer
+	  relies on or uses a fallback mechanism in userspace.
+
+	  Since this was the default firmware loading facility at one point,
+	  old userspace may exist which relies upon it, and as such this
+	  mechanism can never be removed from the kernel.
+
+	  You should only enable this functionality if you are certain you
+	  require a fallback mechanism and have a userspace mechanism ready to
+	  load firmware in case it is not found. Another reason kernels may
+	  have this feature enabled is to support a driver which explicitly
+	  relies on this fallback mechanism. Only two drivers need this today:
+
+	    o CONFIG_LEDS_LP55XX_COMMON
+	    o CONFIG_DELL_RBU
+
+	  Outside of supporting the above drivers, another reason for needing
+	  this may be that your firmware resides outside of the paths the kernel
+	  looks for and cannot possibily be specified using the firmware_class
+	  path module parameter or kernel firmware_class path boot parameter
+	  if firmware_class is built-in.
+
+	  A modern use case may be to temporarily mount a custom partition
+	  during provisioning which is only accessible to userspace, and then
+	  to use it to look for and fetch the required firmware. Such type of
+	  driver functionality may not even ever be desirable upstream by
+	  vendors, and as such is only required to be supported as an interface
+	  for provisioning. Since udev's firmware loading facility has been
+	  removed you can use firmwared or a fork of it to customize how you
+	  want to load firmware based on uevents issued:
+	  https://github.com/teg/firmwared
+
+	  Enabling this option will increase your kernel image size by about
+	  13436 bytes.
+
+	  If you are unsure about this, say N here, unless you are Linux
+	  distribution and need to support the above two drivers, or you are
+	  certain you need to support some really custom firmware loading
+	  facility in userspace.
