The interrupt affinity spreading mechanism supports to spread out
affinities for one or more interrupt sets. A interrupt set contains one
or more interrupts. Each set is mapped to a specific functionality of a
device, e.g. general I/O queues and read I/O queus of multiqueue block
devices.

The number of interrupts per set is defined by the driver. It depends on
the total number of available interrupts for the device, which is
determined by the PCI capabilites and the availability of underlying CPU
resources, and the number of queues which the device provides and the
driver wants to instantiate.

The driver passes initial configuration for the interrupt allocation via
a pointer to struct affinity_desc.

Right now the allocation mechanism is complex as it requires to have a
loop in the driver to determine the maximum number of interrupts which
are provided by the PCI capabilities and the underlying CPU resources.
This loop would have to be replicated in every driver which wants to
utilize this mechanism. That's unwanted code duplication and error
prone.

In order to move this into generic facilities it is required to have a
mechanism, which allows the recalculation of the interrupt sets and
their size, in the core code. As the core code does not have any
knowledge about the underlying device, a driver specific callback will
be added to struct affinity_desc, which will be invoked by the core
code. The callback will get the number of available interupts as an
argument, so the driver can calculate the corresponding number and size
of interrupt sets.

To support this, two modifications for the handling of struct
affinity_desc are required:

1) The (optional) interrupt sets size information is contained in a
   separate array of integers and struct affinity_desc contains a
   pointer to it.

   This is cumbersome and as the maximum number of interrupt sets is
   small, there is no reason to have separate storage. Moving the size
   array into struct affinity_desc avoids indirections makes the code
   simpler.

2) At the moment the struct affinity_desc pointer which is handed in from
   the driver and passed through to several core functions is marked
   'const'.

With the upcoming callback to recalculate the number and size of
interrupt sets, it's necessary to remove the 'const' qualifier. Otherwise
the callback would not be able to update the data.

This patch does the 1st thing and stores interrupt sets size in
'struct irq_affinity'.
