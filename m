What needs to happen in page_mkclean() depends on the caller. Most of the
callers really need to be sure the page is write-protected once
page_mkclean() returns. Those are:

  pagecache_isize_extended()
  fb_deferred_io_work()
  clear_page_dirty_for_io() if called for data-integrity writeback - which
    is currently known only in its caller (e.g. write_cache_pages()) where
    it can be determined as wbc->sync_mode == WB_SYNC_ALL. Getting this
    information into page_mkclean() will require some plumbing and
    clear_page_dirty_for_io() has some 50 callers but it's doable.

clear_page_dirty_for_io() for cleaning writeback (wbc->sync_mode !=
WB_SYNC_ALL) can just skip pinned pages and we probably need to do that as
otherwise memory cleaning would get stuck on pinned pages until RDMA
drivers release its pins.

wait_on_page_bit_common() and associated wait queue handling is a fast path
so we should not make it slower for such special case as waiting for DMA
pin. OTOH we could probably refactor most of the infrastructure to take
pointer to word with flags instead of pointer to page. I'm not sure how the
result will look like but it's probably worth a try.
