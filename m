Oliver can you look into this ? You sais the memory was effectively
hotplug'ed into the system when creating the struct pages. That would
mean to me that it's a) mapped (which for us is cachable, maybe x86 has
tricks to avoid that) and b) potentially used to populate userspace
pages (that will definitely be cachable). Unless there's something in
there you didn't see that prevents it.

ppc64.

Not fan of that approach.

So there are two issues to consider here:

 - Our MMIO space is very far away from memory (high bits set in the
address) which causes problem with things like vmmemmap, page_address,
virt_to_page etc... Do you have similar issues on arm64 ?

 - We need to ensure that the mechanism (which I'm not familiar with)
that you use to create the struct page's for the device don't end up
turning those device pages into normal "general use" pages for the
system. Oliver thinks it does, you say it doesn't, ... 

Jerome (Glisse), what's your take on this ? Smells like something that
could be covered by HMM...

Logan, the only reason you need struct page's to begin with is for the
DMA API right ? Or am I missing something here ?

Cheers,
Ben.
