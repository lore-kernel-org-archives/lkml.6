Why would userspace necessarily see EPERM? The PID might get recycled
into a different random process that the caller has the ability to
affect.

When you reopen via /proc/self/fd, you get a new struct file
referencing the existing inode, not the same struct file. A new
reference to the old struct file would just be dup.

Anyway: what other API requires, for correct operation, occasional
reopening through /proc/self/fd? It's cumbersome, and it doesn't add
anything. If we invalidate process handles on execve, and processes
are legally allowed to re-exec themselves for arbitrary reasons at any
time, that's tantamount to saying that handles might become invalid at
any time and that all callers must be prepared to go through the
reopen-and-retry path before any operation.

Why are we making them do that? So that a process can have an open FD
that represents a process-operation capability? Which capability does
the open FD represent?

I think when you and Andy must be talking about is an API that looks like this:

int open_process_operation_handle(int procfs_dirfd, int capability_bitmask)

capability_bitmask would have bits like

PROCESS_CAPABILITY_KILL --- send a signal
PROCESS_CAPABILITY_PTRACE --- attach to a process
PROCESS_CAPABILITY_READ_EXIT_STATUS --- what it says on the tin
PROCESS_CAPABILITY_READ_CMDLINE --- etc.

Then you'd have system calls like

int process_kill(int process_capability_fd, int signo, const union sigval data)
int process_ptrace_attach(int process_capability_fd)
int process_wait_for_exit(int process_capability_fd, siginfo_t* exit_info)

that worked on these capability bits. If a process execs or does
something else to change its security capabilities, operations on
these capability FDs would fail with ESTALE or something and callers
would have to re-acquire their capabilities.

This approach works fine. It has some nice theoretical properties, and
could allow for things like nicer privilege separation for debuggers.
I wouldn't mind something like this getting into the kernel.

I just don't think this model is necessary right now. I want a small
change from what we have today, one likely to actually make it into
the tree. And bypassing the capability FDs and just allowing callers
to operate directly on process *identity* FDs, using privileges in
effect at the time of all, is at least no worse than what we have now.

That is, I'm proposing an API that looks like this:

int process_kill(int procfs_dfd, int signo, const union sigval value)

If, later, process_kill were to *also* accept process-capability FDs,
nothing would break.

Not the case. Zombies have died, but profs operations work fine on zombies.

Only if you're the parent. Otherwise, you can't see the process exit
status unless you pass a ptrace access check and consult
/proc/pid/stat after the process dies, but before the zombie
disappears. Random unrelated and unprivileged processes can't see exit
statuses from distant parts of the system.

Yes, that's what I have in mind. A siginfo_t is small enough that we
could just store it as a blob allocated off the procfs inode or
something like that without bothering with a shmfs file. You'd be able
to read(2) the exit status as many times as you wanted.
