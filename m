I think we should clear the concept of SVA/SVM here. As my understanding, Share
Virtual Address/Memory means: any virtual address in a process can be used by
device at the same time. This requires IOMMU device to support PASID. And
optionally, it requires the feature of page-fault-from-device.

But before the feature is settled down, IOMMU can be used immediately in the
current kernel. That make it possible to assign ONE process's virtual addresses
to the device's IOMMU page table with GUP. This make WarpDrive work well for one
process.

Now We are talking about SVA and PASID, just to make sure WarpDrive can benefit
from the feature in the future. It dose not means WarpDrive is useless before
that. And it works for our Zip and RSA accelerators in physical world.

Let me show you how the model will be if I use VFIO:

Setup (Kernel part)
	- Kernel driver do every as usual to serve the other functionality, NIC
	  can still be registered to netdev, encryptor can still be registered
	  to crypto...
	- At the same time, the driver can devote some of its hardware resource
	  and register them as a mdev creator to the VFIO framework. This just
	  need limited change to the VFIO type1 driver.

Setup (User space)
	- System administrator create mdev via the mdev creator interface.
	- Following VFIO setup routine, user space open the mdev's group, there is
	  only one group for one device.
	- Without PASID support, you don't need to do anything. With PASID, bind
	  the PASID to the device via VFIO interface.
	- Get the device from the group via VFIO interface and mmap it the user
	  space for device's MMIO access (for the queue).
	- Map whatever memory you need to share with the device with VFIO
	  interface.
	- (opt) Add more devices into the container if you want to share the
	  same address space with them

Cleanup:
	- User space close the group file handler
	- There will be a problem to let the other process know the mdev is
	  freed to be used again. My RFCv1 choose a file handler solution. Alex
	  dose not like it. But it is not a big problem. We can always have a
	  scheduler process to manage the state of the mdev or even we can
	  switch back to the RFCv1 solution without too much effort if we like
	  in the future. 

Except for the minimum update to the type1 driver and use sdmdev to manage the
interrupt sharing, I don't need any extra code to gain the address sharing
capability. And the capability will be strengthen along with the upgrade of VFIO.

As I have explain, if I don't use VFIO, at lease I have to do all that has been
done in i915 or even more than that.

But it is not my decision, that how the iommu subsystem is designed. Personally
I don't like it at all, because all our hardwares have their own stream id
(device id). I don't need the group concept at all. But the iommu subsystem
assume some devices may share the name device ID to a single IOMMU.
