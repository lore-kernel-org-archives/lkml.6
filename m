Hi Neil, Tommi,

Reviving this old thread about "unregister_netdevice: waiting for lo
to become free. Usage count = 3" hangs.
I still did not have time to deep dive into what happens there (too
many bugs coming from syzbot). But this still actively happens and I
suspect accounts to a significant portion of various hang reports,
which are quite unpleasant.

One idea that could make it all simpler:

Is this wait loop in netdev_wait_allrefs() supposed to wait for any
prolonged periods of time under any non-buggy conditions? E.g. more
than 1-2 minutes?
If it only supposed to wait briefly for things that already supposed
to be shutting down, and we add a WARNING there after some timeout,
then syzbot will report all info how/when it happens, hopefully
extracting reproducers, and all the nice things.
But this WARNING should not have any false positives under any
realistic conditions (e.g. waiting for arrival of remote packets with
large timeouts).

Looking at some task hung reports, it seems that this code holds some
mutexes, takes workqueue thread and prevents any progress with
destruction of other devices (and net namespace creation/destruction),
so I guess it should not wait for any indefinite periods of time?
