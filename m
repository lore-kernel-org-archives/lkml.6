As I mentioned, it is only for the sake of performance, and IO scheduler
has to be supported on these devices too, for example, one partition may
be under dm-rq, and another partition can be accessed directly.

However, you are fixing the handling when queue is quiesced or stopped.
Under this situation, it is fine to put requests into scheduler queue,
given no performance need to be worried.

Thanks,
Ming
