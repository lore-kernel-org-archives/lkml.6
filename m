I am wondering what does it practically mean for metdata only copy up
patches. Given this is uprobe code, I am assuming its modifying some
executable code dynamically. And for the the case of metadata only
copy up, it will return inode of lower. That probably means, as long
as all running instances of that exeutable are using that inode, things
will work fine.

But if for some reason somebody opens that file for WRITE and triggers
copy up and new instances of same binary will not see the probe taking
affect?

Which is probably very similar to what will happen if a lower executable
is copied up. Having said that, in normal cases there should not be a
need to copy up a binary in normal circumstances.

Am I missing the point completely.

Thanks
Vivek
