Previously we printed "id", which was constructed above from "dev":

  id = ((dev->bus->number << 8) | dev->devfn);

so even if we print "id=%04x", it contains exactly the same
information as the bus/device/function printed using "dev".

So no, I don't think "Unregistered Agent ID" means a device not registered
with the kernel.  At any rate, we do have a pci_dev for it.

I *think* "info->status == 0" means PCI_ERR_COR_STATUS (or
PCI_ERR_UNCOR_STATUS) was zero, i.e., we didn't find any error status
bits set for this device.  I don't think "Unregistered Agent ID" is a
very good description of this situation.
