In that case it seems like the only way to use SGX that's not a gaping
security hole is to run the SGX enclave in its own fully-seccomp (or
equivalent) process, with no host application in the same address
space. Since the host application can't see the contents of the
enclave to make any determination of whether it's safe to run, running
it in the same address space only makes sense if the cpu provides
protection against unwanted accesses to the host's memory from the
enclave -- and according to you, it doesn't.
