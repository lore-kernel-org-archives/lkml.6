Write back under bounce buffer is fine, when looking back at links you
provided the solution that was discuss was blocking in page_mkclean()
which is horrible in my point of view.

I am not saying stop using their hardware, i am saying their hardware do
things it should not do because the driver developer did not do their due
diligence in understanding what GUP really is. As a result i believe that
what ever solution we decide to have must penalize only and only users of
such device drivers. It should not hurt the general case with sane hw.

So the mapcount == refcount (modulo extra reference for mapping and
private) should holds, here are the case when it does not:
    - page being migrated
    - page being isolated from LRU
    - mempolicy changes against the page
    - page cache lookup
    - some file system activities
    - i likely miss couples here i am doing that from memory

What matter is that all of the above are transitory, the extra reference
only last for as long as it takes for the action to finish (migration,
mempolicy change, ...).

So skipping those false positive page while reclaiming likely make sense,
the blocking free buffer maybe not.

I am fine with having symetry with GUP and put_user_page() so this
patchset is fine from my POV. But i was looking at the final solution
and what the first links suggested when digging the internet was the
lets block forever in page_mkclean() and that is not fine. The bounce
buffer solution is fine it will put the extra cost burden onto user of
such broken hardware.

Thanks for looking into all that,
Cheers,
Jérôme
