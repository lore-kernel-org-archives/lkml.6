Yes, sounds good. We try to decode it as MCE and if we cannot, we dump
the raw CPER record.

I'm fine if you do it separately, as long as you do it so that we have
user-friendly decoding in the end.

Yap.

Ack.

Yeah, if you think about it, CPER is a clumsy and totally useless
indirection layer between MCA and the OS. And if the error is of
different type (AER, PCI, whatever), then it wraps around it too with
some dumb table. And that doesn't bring anything - just the need for
more support added to the OS and tools around it. Basically what you're
doing now.

I don't mind the aspect of firmware seeing the errors first and even
attempting to fix them as the firmware knows the platform intimately but
doing everything in firmware just because some misguided souls think
this gives added value but in reality ends up becoming a worse problem,
is simply the wrong wrong thing to do.

Thx.
