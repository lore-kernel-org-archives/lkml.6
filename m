I could have worded the changelog better.  This is about reserving PCI
bus addresses 0xc0000-0xc7fff, not the VGA framebuffer at
0xa0000-0xbffff.

If I understand correctly, a VGA device will respond to the
framebuffer at 0xa0000-0xbffff, but the device itself will not respond
to the 0xc0000-0xc7fff range.  I think the typical x86 PC arrangement
is that the BIOS reads the VGA option ROM using the normal relocatable
expansion ROM BAR and copies it into system memory at 0xc0000, so it
is in real physical memory.

I don't know what sparc firmware does, but I'm assuming the VGA PCI
device behaves the same in that it wouldn't respond to 0xc0000 itself.

Do you want me to remove the System ROM resource?  If so, I'll
make a separate patch to remove it, followed by one that does
whatever we figure out is the right thing for the video ROM.

Thanks for the feedback.
