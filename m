There are many ways that user pointers can be passed to the kernel, and
I'm not sure that it's feasible to catch them all, especially as user
pointers are often passed in data structures (e.g. iovecs) rather than
direct syscall arguments.

If we *really* want the kernel to support taking tagged addresses, anything
with a __user annotation (or cast to something with a __user annotation)
requires tag removal somewhere in the kernel.

It looks like there are plenty uapi structures and syscalls to look at:

[mark@lakrids:~/src/linux]% git grep __user -- include/uapi | wc -l
216
[mark@lakrids:~/src/linux]% git grep __user | grep SYSCALL_DEFINE | wc -l
308

... in addition to special syscalls like ioctl which multiplex a number
of operations with different arguments, where the tag stripping would
have to occur elsewhere (e.g. in particular drivers).

I also wonder if we ever write any of these pointers back to userspace
memory. If so, we have a nasty ABI problem, since we'll have to marshal
the original tag along with the pointer, to ensure userspace pointer
comparisons continue to work.

Thanks,
Mark.
