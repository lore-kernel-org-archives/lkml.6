Your understanding is right. Ideally pci-epf-test driver shouldn't have any HW
specific configuration. But different HW have different configurations and
pci-epf-test should be informed of the configuration the HW supports.

configfs is just one way of creating epf_device and it was mainly added since
pci-epf-test cannot have a dt entry because it doesn't represent anything in
the HW.

The other option was to have a callback to EPC driver to get the features it
supports. But a particular feature that is required might be specific to a EPF
driver.

I find the driver_data approach in pci_epf_device_id to be more clean.

Thanks
Kishon
