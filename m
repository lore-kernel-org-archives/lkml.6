I am not questioning that. What I am saying is that the configuration
doesn't make much sense and the kernel warns about it.

[This is an orthogonal discussion I believe]

How does it differ from pr_err though?

Well, you get a precise location where the problem happens and the
backtrace to see how it happened. This is much more information than,
pr_err without dump_stack.

Yeah, and that was the purpose of the thing.

But this is not applicable here. Your misconfiguration is quite obvious
because you simply set the hard limit to 0. This is not the only
situation when this can happen. There is no clear point to tell, you are
doing this wrong. If it was we would do it at that point obviously.

If you have a strong reason to believe that this is an abuse of WARN I
am all happy to change that. But I haven't heard any yet, to be honest.
