Hi All,

Here is v7 patch-series adding drivers for FPGA DFL devices.

This patch series provides a common framework to support FPGA Device
Feature List (DFL) and also feature dev drivers under this DFL framework
to provide interfaces for userspace applications to configure, enumerate,
open and access FPGA accelerators on DFL based FPGA device and enables
system level management functions such as FPGA partial reconfiguration,
power management and virtualization.

This patch series only adds the basic functions for FPGA accelerators and
partial reconfiguration. Patches for more functions, e.g. power management
and virtualization, will be submitted after this series gets reviewed.

Note this patch series is only verified on DFL based Intel(R) FPGA PCIe
devices (e.g. Intel Server Platform with In-package FPGA and Intel FPGA
PCIe Acceleration Cards).

Patch 1: add a document for FPGA DFL framework driver overview, including
Device Feature List (DFL) introduction, the HW architecture, driver
organization, device enumeration and opens.

Patch 2: add region_id for fpga_image_info data structure, which allows
driver to pass region id information to fpga-mgr for FPGA reconfiguration
function. (Used by Patch 17)

Patch 3: add a 'status' sysfs interface to fpga-mgr class, it reflects
the status of the fpga-mgr including reconfiguration errors. (Used by
Patch 18)

Patch 4-5: add compat_id support in fpga manager and region, this compat
id is used for compatibility check before further actions (e.g. partial
reconfiguration). (Used by Patch 19 and 22)

Patch 6-11: add FPGA device feature list support, it provides common
enumeration interfaces which creates container device (FPGA base region)
and all feature devices by walking through all the 'Device Feature Lists'
provided low level drivers. A global list is added to DFL framework to
manage port ops from different ports.

Patch 12-13: implement FPGA PCIe device driver. It locates all 'Device
Feature Lists' in PCIe device memory and invokes common interfaces from
above device feature list framework to finish the enumeration.

Patch 14-17: implement FPGA Management Engine (FME) driver. It's a
platform driver matching with the FME platform device created by above
device feature list framework during enumeration. Sysfs and device file
ioctls are exposed as user interfaces to allow partial reconfiguration
to Accelerated Function Units (AFUs) from user space applications.

Patch 18-22: implement FPGA manager/bridge/region platform drivers for
Intel FPGA Management Engine (FME). These platform drivers match with
platform devices created by above FME driver, they use the generic
fpga-mgr/bridge/region class infrastructure to implement FPGA partial
reconfiguration function.

Patch 23-28: implement FPGA Accelerated Function Unit (AFU) driver.
It's a platform driver matching with AFU platform device created by above
device feature list framework during enumeration. It provides user
interfaces to expose the AFU MMIO region, map/unmap dma buffer and
control the port which AFU connects to.

Patch 29: add a entry in MAINTAINERS for this FPGA DFL drivers patchset.

Changes from v6:
- Improve Kconfig description, fix typos and other comments.
- Update target kernelversion in sysfs doc.
- Fix issues reported by kbuild.
- Simplify pcie driver by using pcim_xxx functions.

Changes from v5:
- Improve functions/APIs naming per suggestion from Alan Tull.
- Improve DFL framework code and comments to simplify the work for adding
  a new feature device support.
- Correct the time in copyright and fix other comments from Alan Tull.
- Add a entry in MAINTAINERS for this FPGA DFL drivers patchset.

Changes from v4:
- Update the dfl.txt documentation, remove descriptions for the APIs and
  features which are not implemented in this patch series.
- Add DFL_ / dfl_ prefix for APIs and data structure, to avoid directly
  using fpga_xxx as definition.
- Use "static region" and "PR bistream" instead of "blue bitstream" and
  "green bistream" in description to avoid misunderstanding.
- Fix building issues caused by BIT() on 64bit register definition and
  missing correct header file for readq and writeq.
- Remove port specific code in DFL framework and introduce port ops
  support to resolve the dependency issue between FME driver module and
  Port driver module. (more details in Patch 8).
- Add compat id to fpga manager, as in case some hardware implements the
  compat id in fpga manager's register, not register belongs to fpga region
  and it's value is shared by all related fpga regions.
- Pass mapped ioaddr to fme manager platform device from dfl-fme-pr via
  pdata.
- Fix other comments from Alan and Moritze, including description
  improvement, coding style issue and etc.

Changes from v3:
- Fix SPDX license issue.
- Rename documentation to dfl.txt, add introduction for Device Feature List
  (DFL) and re-organize the content.
- Rename to FPGA Device Feature List (DFL) drivers from Intel FPGA device
  drivers for better reuse purposes. Unified driver and files to dfl-*.*
- Remove static feature_info table from common enumeration code and switch
  to use feature id for sub feature driver matching.
- Remove next_afu register checking for AFU from common enumeration code.
- Remove interface_id sysfs for dfl-fme-mgr and use per fpga-region
  compat_id instead. (new patch 13, 15, 19).
- Add more comments for driver data structures and functions.
- Fix typos, issues in debug message/commit message and other places.

Changes from v2:
- Split common enumeration code from pcie driver to a separated module
  which for device feature list support.
- Drop fpga-dev class and switch to use fpga base region as container.
- Update the intel-fpga.txt documentation for new driver organization.
- Rename feature device drivers for future code reuse.
- Rebase code due to fpga APIs changes
- replace bitfields with marco and shift.
- fix typos, checkpatch issue and other comments.

Changes from v1:
- Use GPLv2 license instead of Dual BSD/GPL.
- Move the code to drivers/fpga folder.
- Update the intel-fpga.txt documentation for new driver organization.
- Add documentation for new sysfs interfaces.
- Switch to use common fpga-region interface for partial reconfiguration
  (PR) function in FME. It creates fpga-region/fpga-mgr/fpga-bridge
  platform devices and leave the implementation to their platform drivers.
- Add platform drivers for FME fpga-mgr/bridge/region platform devices.
- Fix kbuild warnings, typos and other comments.
