My proposition allows for explicit "lsm=3D" list but also accepts non
explicit list. This is it's advantage above current approach.

The current approach works but it seems to target the very same people
who designed it :)

I'm afraid when it hits stable kernel and people will rely on it,
then it will be too late. Things will be even more hard to change
than now when we have to keep legacy syntax of security=3Dxxx.

I added explanation why explicit list doesn't solve consistency
across distros in the other reply
