This doesn't work with how SELinux and AppArmor do their bootparams,
unfortunately. (And Paul and Stephen have expressed that the
documented selinux on/off must continue to work.) For example, let's
say you've built an Ubuntu kernel with:

CONFIG_SELINUX=y
...
CONFIG_LSM="yama,apparmor"

(i.e. you want SELinux available, but not enabled, so it's left out of
CONFIG_LSM)

Then someone boots the system with:

selinux=1 security=selinux

In what order does selinux get initialized relative to yama?
(apparmor, flagged as a "legacy major", would have been disabled by
the "security=" not matching it.)


The LSM order needs to be defined externally to enablement because
something may become enabled when not listed in the order.

Now, maybe I misunderstood your earlier suggestion, and what you meant
was to do something like:

CONFIG_LSM="yama,apparmor,!selinux"

to mean "put selinux here in the order, but don't enable it". Then the
problem becomes what happens to an LSM that has been built in but not
listed in CONFIG_LSM?

Related to that, this means that when new LSMs are added, they will
need to be added to any custom CONFIG_LSM= or lsm= parameters. If
that's really how we have to go, I'll accept it, but I think it's a
bit unfriendly. :P

Another reason I don't like it is because it requires users to know
about all the LSMs to make changes. One LSM can't be added/removed
without specifying ALL of the LSMs. (i.e. there is no trivial way to
enable/disable a single LSM without it growing its own enable/disable
code as in SELinux/AppArmor. I'd hoped to make that easier for both
users and developers.) Again, I can live with it, but I think it's
unfriendly.

I just want to have a direct I can go that meets all the requirements.
:) I'm fine to ignore my sense of aesthetics if everyone can agree on
the code.

Correct. I've made sure that's true in all the versions.

BTW, there doesn't seem to be disagreement about the earlier part of
the series, though (patches 1-10). Could these go into -next just so I
don't have to keep sending them? :)

LSM: Correctly announce start of LSM initialization
vmlinux.lds.h: Avoid copy/paste of security_init section
LSM: Rename .security_initcall section to .lsm_info
LSM: Remove initcall tracing
LSM: Convert from initcall to struct lsm_info
vmlinux.lds.h: Move LSM_TABLE into INIT_DATA
LSM: Convert security_initcall() into DEFINE_LSM()
LSM: Record LSM name in struct lsm_info
LSM: Provide init debugging infrastructure
LSM: Don't ignore initialization failures

Thanks!
