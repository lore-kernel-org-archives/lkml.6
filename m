I think I've got the root cause.  I have one system in my test bed
exhibiting this behaviour.  It turns out the disk in it has no
characteristics VPD page.  The 0xB1 VPD was a SBC-3 addition, so that's
not surprising.  However, the characteristics check bails before
setting the flags, so it takes the default flag which has flipped.

We can either fix this by setting the QUEUE_FLAG_ADD_RANDOM if there's
no 0xB1 page or by setting the default as Jens proposed.
