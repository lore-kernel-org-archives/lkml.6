He said the same thing a year ago. And there was small progress. 6 out of 
27 __vmalloc calls were converted to memalloc_noio_save in a year - 5 in 
infiniband and 1 in btrfs. (the whole discussion is here 
http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1706.3/04681.html )

He refuses 15-line patch to fix GFP_NOIO bug because he believes that in 4 
years, the kernel will be refactored and GFP_NOIO will be eliminated. Why 
does he have veto over this part of the code? I'd much rather argue with 
people who have constructive comments about fixing bugs than with him.

(note that even if the refactoring eventually succeeds, it will not be 
backported to stable branches. The small vmalloc patch could be 
backported)

That's the problem - the flag doesn't have a clear contract and the 
developers change behavior ad hoc according to bug reports.

How would you call it? Michal falsely believes that a 15-line patch would 
prevent him from doing long-term refactoring work and so he refuses it.

I sent the CONFIG_DEBUG_SG patch before (I wonder why he didn't repond to 
it). I'll send a third version of the patch that actually randomly chooses 
between kmalloc and vmalloc, because some abuses can only be detected with 
kmalloc and we should test both.

For bisecting, it is better to always fallback to vmalloc, but for general 
testing, it is better to test both branches.
