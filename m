Trapping EINIT is what I have in mind.

Hmm, maybe.  Or we can use Jarkko=E2=80=99s securityfs attribute thingy.

Concretely, I think there are two things we care about:

First, if the host enforces some policy as to which enclaves can
launch, then it should apply the same policy to guests =E2=80=94 otherwise =
KVM
lets programs do an end run around the policy. So, in the initial
incarnation of this, QEMU should probably have to open the provision
attribute fd if it wants its guest to be able to EINIT a provisioning
enclave.  When someone inevitably adds an EINIT LSM hook, the KVM
interface should also call it.

Second, the normal enclave interface won't allow user code to supply
an EINITTOKEN, so the KVM interface will presumably need to be
different, unless we're going to emulate EINIT by ignoring the token.
That seems like a very strange thing to do.
