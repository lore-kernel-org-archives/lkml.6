Great, thanks for the confirmation.

IANAL, but my recommendations below.

Trying to get all interested parties on Linux to agree PostgreSQL is
indeed GPL-Compatible is certainly possible but may require a bit of
legal billable hours on quite a bit of parts in the community. It takes
a long time...

Dual licensing would be preferred to avoid adding yet-another-license
and possibile ambiguities over compatibility, however, that would
require the original copyright holder's permission.

You can poke if you'd like, however there are two other alternatives.

a) License new code to GPL and add provenance notice for PostgreSQL
	-  Useful if we know upstream PostgreSQL does not care for our
	   own changes

b) Dual license GPL/PostgreSQL with provenance notice for the original
   PostgreSQL code.

   	- Useful if we know PostgreSQL may be interested in reaping
	  benefit of our own changes on Linux as well.

a) and b) are possible if you made changes to the code (even space and
style changes count). If you opt for a) our code on Linux and evolutions of it
remains GPL, but would annotate provenance from the PostgreSQL license.
It'd include language such as:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<GPL header>

  * This file incorporates work covered by the following copyright and
  * permission notice: 

<Original PostgreSQL header and copyrght notice>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So for instance this strategy was done on the carl9170 device driver rewrite
where Johannes took ISC licensed otus device driver from staging and
rewrote the driver based on it, an example file with the notice:

drivers/net/wireless/ath/carl9170/phy.c

This followed the guidence previously provided by SFLC on dealing with
this [0].

But since there may be other code coming up we have to consider what the
goals are.

  - Is the plan to consider incorporating more PostgreSQL
    licensed code on Linux? 

  - Is the goal to also let the PostgreSQL reap benefit of our own
    enhancements?
    
If so for both then, and we if we really dont' want to get a good set of
company attorneys to say "PostgreSQL is GPL compatible", then b)
should work. It would be something like:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<GPL header>
etc... later version; or, when distributed separately from the Linux kernel or      
when incorporated into other software packages, subject to the license:    

<latest PostgreSQL header and copyrght notice with your name>

  * This file incorporates work covered by the following copyright and
  * permission notice: 

<Original PostgreSQL header and copyrght notice>
