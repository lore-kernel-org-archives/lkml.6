Hmmm, I don't understand how you can do this if there is a filesystem built on
your DM device?  Say you have a DM device, either striped or linear, that is
made up of 2 devices, and then you use dmsetup to replace one of the DM member
devices with something else.  You've just swapped out half of your LBA space
with new data, right? 

I don't understand how you can expect a filesystem built on the old DM device
to still work?  You especially can't do this while the filesystem is mounted -
all the in-core filesystem metadata would be garbage because the on-media data
would have totally changed.

So, when dealing with a filesystem, the flow must be:

unmount your filesystem
redo your DM device, changing out devices
reformat your filesystem on the new DM device
remount your filesystem

Right?  If so, then I don't see how a transition of the DM device from
supporting DAX to not supporting DAX or vice versa could harm us, as we can't
be doing filesystem I/O at the time when we change the composition of the DM
device.
