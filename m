Agreed. I hesitated but saw addresses were generally described  with
bits[51:12] in regs such as PROPBASER/PENDBASER and I did not really
need the spare bits.

I copied the description in KVM_VGIC_V3_ADDR_TYPE_REDIST ;-) I knew that
for GICv4 the number of 64kB pages per redist is different so I thought
it was more generic. But I don't have a strong opinion.

OK
