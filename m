Yeah, forgot to include that.

As Jethro mentioned, RAX will always be 4 on a successful EEXIT, so we
can use RAX to indicate a fault.  That's what I was trying to imply with
EFAULT.  Here's the reg stuffing I use for the POC:

	regs->ax = EFAULT;
	regs->di = trapnr;
	regs->si = error_code;
	regs->dx = address;


Well-known RAX values also means the kernel fault handlers only need to
look for SOME_SILLY_PREFIX ENCLU if RAX==2 || RAX==3, i.e. the fault
occurred on EENTER or in an enclave (RAX is set to ERESUME's leaf as
part of the asynchronous enlcave exit flow).
