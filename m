Can you please add a cover letter and series revision the next time
you post this?  See the list archives for samples.  That helps me know
when I can ignore old patches when they've been superseded.

I think you also need to put something in the "To:" header.  I usually
use linux-pci@vger.kernel.org when there's no other obvious candidate.
Mutt doesn't seem to handle the empty To: header correctly; I see this
when responding:

  Cc: no To-header on input <;,
	"mika.westerberg@linux.intel.com" <mika.westerberg@linux.intel.com>,
	...

You could probably also trim the CC: list.  I'm not sure *all* of them
will be interested in PCI details like this.  But I don't really want
to offend any of them by suggesting names to remove :)

If it's possible to distill a concrete example of an actual case that
previously failed and now works, with real addresses from dmesg or
similar, that is as small as possible, that might help understand the
changes you're making.

Thanks for the comment cleanups.  I do want those, but it's better if
you can do the minimal changes required to accompany the code changes,
followed by a second patch that does *only* the reformatting required
by checkpatch.  That way the second patch will be trivial to review,
since it's obvious that it doesn't change any code.  It also avoids
cluttering the actual bug-fix or feature-add patches with changes to
unrelated comments.  It's OK if the bug-fix patch is not 100%
checkpatch-clean, as long as it doesn't make things *worse*.  It's
even OK if the final patch is not 100% checkpatch-clean; human
judgment is required to interpret the things it complains about.

I would wait a few days before reposting to address that.  Sometimes
other people will comment and you can take care of those comments at
the same time.  It's a little frustrating as a reviewer to spend a
lot of time reviewing v1 only to find that v2 and v3 have been
posted with significant changes while you were looking at v1.
