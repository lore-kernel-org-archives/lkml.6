Then looks serialized reset should be used, and I did see the commit
79c48ccf2fe ("nvme-pci: serialize pci resets") fixes issue of 'failed
to mark controller state' in reset stress test.

But that commit only covers case of PCI reset from sysfs attribute, and
maybe other cases need to be dealt with in similar way too.

Thanks,
Ming
