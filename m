For fsnotify, whoever is calling [fanotify|inotify]_handle_event()
will have a stable reference to fsnotify_group and fsnotify_group has
reference to memcg. These allocations happen within
[fanotify|inotify]_handle_event(), so, for fsnotify I don't think
there will be use-after-free bugs.

Basically whoever is calling memcg variant of kmem_cache_alloc or
kmalloc should either have stable direct or indirect reference to the
memcg.

No, both page cache and metadata to a different memcg.

Please do let me know if you have something in mind.

I will see if I can find out a way for that.
