Right, I'm not sure it really is OTP and not flash, but many touchscreen
controllers do come with their firmware embedded into the controller, but
not all unfortunately.

This is not part of the standard. There has been a long(ish) standing issue
with us not being able to get re-distribute permission for the firmware for
some touchscreen controllers found on cheap x86 devices. Which means that
we cannot put it in Linux firmware.

Dave Olsthoorn (in the Cc) noticed that the touchscreen did work in the
refind bootload UI, so the EFI code must have a copy of the firmware.

I asked Peter Jones for suggestions how to extract this during boot and
he suggested seeing if there was a copy of the firmware in the
EFI_BOOT_SERVICES_CODE memory segment, which it turns out there is.

My patch to add support for this contains a table of device-model (dmi
strings), firmware header (first 64 bits), length and crc32 and then if
we boot on a device-model which is in the table the code scans the
EFI_BOOT_SERVICES_CODE for the prefix, if found checks the crc and
caches the firmware for later use by request-firmware.

So I just do a brute-force search for the firmware, this really is hack,
nothing standard about it I'm afraid. But it works on 4 different x86
tablets I have and makes the touchscreen work OOTB on them, so I believe
it is a worthwhile hack to have.

I don't think this is a problem for any normal drivers, when I say pretty
late I mean late in init/main.c: start_kernel(), so still before any normal
drivers load.

The first idea was to scan for the firmware at the same time we check for
things as the ACPI BGRT logo stuff, but as mentioned that requires using
early_mmap() which does not work for the amount of memory we want to map.

As said I think we still do it early enough for any driver use, when
I wrote "late in the init sequence" I should have probably written something
else, like "near the end of start_kernel() instead of from setup_arch()"

Yes.

See above, this still runs before start_kernel() calls rest_init() which is
where any normal init calls (and driver probing) happens so still early
enough for any users I can think of. I think my poorly worded commit
message is causing a bit of unnecessary confusion here, sorry about that.

The debug only thing is only patch 1/2, which is mostly independent of this
patch (which is 2/2), patch 1 exports the EFI_BOOT_SERVICES_* memory segments
as blobs under /sys/kernel/debug/efi, which requires not freeing them
(or making a copy) and this costs memory. The purpose of this is to be
able to easily check them for embedded firmwares when adding new entries
to the table of known embedded firmwares used by this patch.

This patch will work fine without the first patch even being present in
the kernel and will also work fine without efi=debug.

That requires making significant changes to the early bringup code on
ARM, x86 keeps EFI_BOOT_SERVICES_* memory-segments around until near
the end of start_kernel() because freeing them earlier triggers bugs
in some x86 EFI implementations, ARM EFI implementations do not have
these bugs, so they free them almost directly at boot.

Changing this really falls outside the scope of this patch.

The fw_get_efi_embedded_fw() call is not that expensive, it walks the
list of found firmwares, does a strcmp on the name and that is all it does,
so I did not really see this as a problem, but if you want me to change this
that is certainly possible.

Yes that is certainly possible, currently there are 2 touchscreen drivers which
can use this drivers/input/touchscreen/silead.c and
drivers/input/touchscreen/chipone_icn8505.c, with the latter being a driver I just
finished this weekend and which I will submit upstream soon.

Ok, I usually prefer to only merge the relevant subsys-next into my personal
tree rather then consuming the entirety of -next, which subsys tree has
the firmware bits ?

It is not like we are ever going to have more then 2-3 embedded
firmwares in the foreseeable future and having a static array
saves the need to kmalloc the struct embedded_fw and the additional
error handling for when this fails, so the array leads to simpler
code. But if you really want me to change this over to a linked
list I can change it.

Definitely not part of the standard, this is just observed behavior on

Using kmalloc still requires memory-management to be setup, just as
using memremap does. The whole "needs to be run late" comment is
about this needing to run after mm_init(). Anyways as said I think
the whole when to run this discussion is a red herring based on my
poor choice of words in the commit message.

But doing a kmemdup on found firmware instead would avoid
the need for efi_mem_reserve()...

If we want to use efi_mem_reserve() no, because the memory descriptors
are in an array and the entire array gets re-allocated on changes.

Note AFAICT this MUST be an array because we pass it to the EFI firmware,
but your suggestion to use kmemdup on the firmware would fix the need for
efi_mem_reserve() fixing the fragility, so that probably is a better way
to deal with this.
