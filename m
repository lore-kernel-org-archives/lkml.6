I see the allure of this, but I think down the road you will
discover passing a flag in libvirt XML saying
"please use a secure mode" or whatever is a good idea.

Even thought it is probably not required to address this
specific issue.

For example, I don't think ballooning works in secure mode,
you will be able to teach libvirt not to try to add a
balloon to the guest.

That's probably a good idea too.

That part feels gross, yes.

I think you are right that for the dma limit the hypervisor doesn't seem
to need to know.

I don't believe you'll be able to avoid that entirely. The split between
libvirt and qemu is more about community than about code, random bits of
functionality tend to land on random sides of that fence.  Better add a
tag in domain XML early is my advice. Having said that, it's your
hypervisor. I'm just suggesting that when hypervisor does somehow need
to care then I suspect most people won't be receptive to the argument
that changing libvirt is a nightmare.
