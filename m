Well, I see your points. My idea was not to separate read and write
on platform that can lock both. I think it is no problem to also 
unlocking writes when we are doing a read, so on platforms that can do 
both I think both should do the same..

The idea was to avoid spending time unlocking writes for doing a read on 
platforms on which reads are not locked. And for platforms able to 
independently unlock/lock reads and writes, if only unlocking reads can 
improve performance it can be interesting as well.

For book3s/32, locking/unlocking will be done through Kp/Ks bits in 
segment registers, the function won't be trivial as it may involve more 
than one segment at a time. So I just wanted to avoid spending time 
doing that for reads as reads won't be protected. And may also be the 
case on older book3s/64, may not it ?
On Book3s/32, the page protection bits are as follows:

   Key	0	1
PP
00	RW	NA
01	RW	RO
10	RW	RW
11	RO	RO

So the idea is to encode user RW with PP01 (instead of PP10 today) and 
user RO with PP11 (as done today), giving Key0 to user and Key1 to 
kernel (today both user and kernel have Key1). Then when kernel needs to 
write, we change Ks to Key0 in segment register for the involved segments.

I'm not sure there is any risk that someone nests unlocks/locks for 
reads and unlocks/locks for writes, because the unlocks/locks are done 
in very limited places.
