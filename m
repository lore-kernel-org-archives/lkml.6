Out of curiosity: Is there any reason why the removal of tilegx is now
being rushed? Did any of the policies regarding architectures in the
kernel change? I had the impression that architectures could previously
stay unmaintained for a while before being removed.

Well, that's quite a bummer. I don't know what Rich Felker's and
Rob Landley's plans now are. Rich told that he would be doing paid
SH work again in the upcoming weeks. I even sent him and Rob SH4
hardware to support their efforts.

I have personally invested a lot of work into the SH port over the
past three years in Debian and I was involved fixing many bugs
and as a result, the port is quite usable. It would be really
disappointing to see it being removed all of a sudden :(.

I will get in touch with Rich and Rob to figure out what's going
on.

Adrian
