Yep.  Even for something more subtle like GPR corruption it could dump the
entire call stack before attempting to return back up.

Yeah, it's not a silver bullet by any means, but it does seem useful for at
least some scenarios.  Even exploding when invoking the handler instead of
at a random point might prove useful, e.g. "calling my exit handler exploded,
maybe my enclave corrupted the stack!".

Speaking of preserving registers, the asm blob needs to mark RBX as
clobbered since it's modified for EEXIT.
