I wonder how many out of tree LSM there are?  Looking at the mainline
kernel the only "small" LSM bundled is YAMA, and it seems that most of
the patches proposing new ones eventually die out.

I appreciate that there are probably a lot of "toy" or "local" modules
out there for specific fields, companies, or products, but it does
seem odd that there are so few discussed publicly.

(The last two I remember were S.A.R.A and something relating to
xattr-attributes being used to whitelist execution.)
