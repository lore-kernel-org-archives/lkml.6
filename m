Seems, like I failed to make my point in the previous message. I do not
have more than adding a directory 'sed_opal' in sysfs for each sed-opal
enabled disk. But that directory is completely empty. My further plans
are, to fill up that directory with some public info like the one that
gets printed by a call to TCG's 'sedutil-cli --query' command.
The interesting part - where I am clueless how to achieve it -  would be
to have a binary sysfs attribute (like mentioned by Christoph) for the
features (like shadow mbr) requiring some kind of authentication. Until
there is any (good) idea, I do not think it is time for an RFC?
