'Allocation' in the sense that there are address ranges allocated, not
memory, but mappings would also be right.

I though about exposing it through DMA-API, but didn't go that route as
I didn't want to extend a generic API for some SWIOTLB specifics. But if
there are more implementations that have a size limitation it makes
certainly sense to put it into the DMA-API. I'll change that in the
next version.

Thanks,
