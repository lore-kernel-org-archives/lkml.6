You still refer to crc32 here. This needs to be updated.

No, as I have requested before I don't want this, it is silly to have such
functionality always be considered as a fallback if we only have 2 drivers
which need this. Please add a call which only if used would then *evaluate*
such fallback prospect.

So NACK for now.
