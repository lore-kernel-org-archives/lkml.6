I don't think those intricacies would go away just by having separate
fields. Perhaps it would make things fail more explicitly. After all,
I think it needs to be a very atomic operation when a device is
switched.

I didn't mean use the wq, but just the list fields. You'd still have
the early list and normal list with different list heads. If you ever
had a device wanting to be on both lists at the same time, then you've
got major problems.
