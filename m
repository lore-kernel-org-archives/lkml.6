I think Linus's comment was dismissed here.


Linus said:

If I understood his comment correctly,
we do not need either WANT_* or _AUTO.




Kees' comment:

> In the stack-protector case, this becomes quite important, since the

No.  Kconfig will not do this silently.


"make oldconfig" (or "make silentoldconfig" as well)
always ask users about new symbols.


For example, let's say your compiler supports -fstack-protector
but not -fstack-protector-strong.
CC_STACKPROTECTOR_REGULAR is the best you can choose.

Then, let's say you upgrade your compiler and the new compiler supports
-fstack-protector-strong as well.

In this case, CC_STACKPROTECTOR_STRONG is a newly visible symbol,
so Kconfig will ask you
"Hey, you were previously using _REGULAR, but your new compiler
also supports _STRONG.  Do you want to use it?"


The "make oldconfig" will look like follows:


masahiro@grover:~/workspace/linux-kbuild$ make oldconfig
  HOSTCC  scripts/kconfig/conf.o
  HOSTLD  scripts/kconfig/conf
scripts/kconfig/conf  --oldconfig Kconfig
*
* Restart config...
*
*
* Linux Kernel Configuration
*
Stack Protector buffer overflow detection
  1. Strong (CC_STACKPROTECTOR_STRONG) (NEW)
> 2. Regular (CC_STACKPROTECTOR_REGULAR)
  3. None (CC_STACKPROTECTOR_NONE)
choice[1-3?]:



Please notice the Strong is marked as "(NEW)".

Kconfig handles this really nicely with Linus' suggestion.

[1] Users can select only features supported by your compiler
    - this makes sense.

[2] If you upgrade your compiler and it provides more capability,
    "make (silent)oldconfig" will ask you about new choices.
     - this also makes sense.



So, the following simple implementation works well enough,
doesn't it?

---------------->8---------------
choice
        prompt "Stack Protector buffer overflow detection"

config CC_STACKPROTECTOR_STRONG
        bool "Strong"
        depends on CC_HAS_STACKPROTECTOR_STRONG
        select CC_STACKPROTECTOR

config CC_STACKPROTECTOR_REGULAR
        bool "Regular"
        depends on CC_HAS_STACKPROTECTOR
        select CC_STACKPROTECTOR

config CC_STACKPROTECTOR_NONE
        bool "None"

endchoice
---------------->8-------------------------



BTW, do we need to use 'choice' ?


The problem of using 'choice' is,
it does not work well with allnoconfig.


For all{yes,mod}config, we want to enable as many features as possible.
For allnoconfig, we want to disable as many as possible.

However, the default of 'choice' is always the first visible value.


So, I can suggest to remove _REGULAR and _NONE.

We have just two bool options, like follows.

------------------->8-----------------
config CC_STACKPROTECTOR
        bool "Use stack protector"
        depends on CC_HAS_STACKPROTECTOR

config CC_STACKPROTECTOR_STRONG
        bool "Use strong strong stack protector"
        depends on CC_STACKPROTECTOR
        depends on CC_HAS_STACKPROTECTOR_STRONG
-------------------->8------------------

This will work well for all{yes,mod,no}config.

We will not have a case where
-fstack-protector-strong is supported, but -fstack-protector is not.
