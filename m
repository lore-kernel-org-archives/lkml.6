So, I really like the concept for patch 1 of this series (but haven't
read the code yet); but I dislike this patch because of its footgun
potential.

If this patch landed as-is, the manpage would need some big warning
labels. chroot() basically provides no security guarantees at all; and
yes, that includes that if you do `chroot(...); chdir("/");
open(attacker_controlled_path, ...);`, you can potentially end up
opening a file outside the chroot. See
https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-secpack/blob/master/QSBs/qsb-014-2015.txt
for an example, where Qubes OS did pretty much that, and ended up with
a potentially exploitable security bug because of that, where one VM,
while performing a file transfer into another VM, could write outside
of the transfer target directory.
The problem is what happens if a folder you are walking through is
concurrently moved out of the chroot. Consider the following scenario:

You attempt to open "C/../../etc/passwd" under the root "/A/B".
Something else concurrently moves /A/B/C to /A/C. This can result in
the following:

1. You start the path walk and reach /A/B/C.
2. The other process moves /A/B/C to /A/C. Your path walk is now at /A/C.
3. Your path walk follows the first ".." up into /A. This is outside
the process root, but you never actually encountered the process root,
so you don't notice.
4. Your path walk follows the second ".." up to /. Again, this is
outside the process root, but you don't notice.
5. Your path walk walks down to /etc/passwd, and the open completes
successfully. You now have an fd pointing outside your chroot.

If the root of your walk is below an attacker-controlled directory,
this of course means that you lose instantly. If you point the root of
the walk at a directory out of which a process in the container
wouldn't be able to move the file, you're probably kinda mostly fine -
as long as you know, for certain, that nothing else on the system
would ever do that. But I still wouldn't feel good about that.

(Yes, this means that if you run an SFTP server with OpenSSH's
ChrootDirectory directive, you have to be very careful about these
things.)

I believe that the only way to robustly use this would be to point the
dirfd at a mount point, such that you know that being moved out of the
chroot is impossible because the mount point limits movement of
directories under it. (Well, technically, it doesn't, but it ensures
that if a directory does dangerously move away, the syscall fails.) It
might make sense to hardcode this constraint in the implementation of
AT_THIS_ROOT, to keep people from shooting themselves in the foot.

Wait. fork() I understand, but why exec? And actually, you don't need
a full fork() either, clone() lets you do this with some process parts
shared. And then you also shouldn't need to use SCM_RIGHTS, just keep
the file descriptor table shared. And why chroot()/pivot_root(),
wouldn't you want to use setns()? I think something like this should
work (except that you should add some error handling - omitted here
because I'm lazy), assuming that the container runtime does NOT have
CAP_SYS_ADMIN in the init namespace (otherwise it's easier). Of
course, this is entirely untested, and probably won't compile because
I screwed something up. :P But you should get the idea...

// Ensure that we are non-dumpable. Together with

// Oh well.
prctl(PR_SET_DUMPABLE, SUID_DUMP_DISABLE);
// Inform gcc that this particular syscall will effectively
// return twice, just like vfork() or setjmp().
__attribute__((returns_twice)) long syscall_(long sysno, ...) = (void*)syscall;
int result_fd = -1;
// CLONE_FILES means we don't need to do fd passing,
//     we share the file descriptor table.
// CLONE_VM means we don't have the cost of duplicating
//     our VMAs and page tables, and we don't have to mark

// CLONE_VFORK is a dirty hack to avoid having to
//     allocate a child stack.
// Lack of SIGCHLD means we don't want to have to wait()
//     for the child.
int child_pid = syscall_(__NR_clone, CLONE_FILES|CLONE_VM|CLONE_VFORK,
0, 0, 0, 0);
if (child_pid == 0) {
  // Enter the container's user namespace; this allows us
  // to afterwards join its mount namespace even if we're
  // not capable in the init namespace.
  // (I believe that it should be possible to change the kernel

  setns(container_user_ns_fd, CLONE_NEWUSER);
  // Entering the filesystem namespace automatically
  // moves us to that namespace's filesystem root.
  setns(container_fs_ns_fd, CLONE_NEWNS);
  result_fd = open(untrusted_container_path, ...);
