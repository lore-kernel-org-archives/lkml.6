This rate estimator is already works as a black-box with smoothing and
low-pass filter inside. It has limitations thus this is ok to declare
range of expected\sane results.

It would be nice to show estimated rate in sysfs to let user
diagnose whenever it is wrong for a long period of time.
Printing message all the time even ratelimited is a wrong idea.
If this should never happens - WARN_ONCE is more than enough.

I suspect crashes might be caused by bumpy timer which was affected by smi/nmi from mce.
I'll try to find evidence.
