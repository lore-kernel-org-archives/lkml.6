+Introduction:
+============
+The Adjunct Processor (AP) facility is an IBM Z cryptographic facility comprised
+of three AP instructions and from 1 up to 256 PCIe cryptographic adapter cards.
+The AP devices provide cryptographic functions to all CPUs assigned to a
+linux system running in an IBM Z system LPAR.
+
+The AP adapter cards are exposed via the AP bus. The motivation for vfio-ap
+is to make AP cards available to KVM guests using the VFIO mediated device
+framework. This implementation relies considerably on the s390 virtualization
+facilities which do most of the hard work of providing direct access to AP
+devices.
+
+AP Architectural Overview:
+=========================
+To facilitate the comprehension of the design, let's start with some
+definitions:
+
+* AP adapter
+
+  An AP adapter is an IBM Z adapter card that can perform cryptographic
+  functions. There can be from 0 to 256 adapters assigned to an LPAR. Adapters
+  assigned to the LPAR in which a linux host is running will be available to
+  the linux host. Each adapter is identified by a number from 0 to 255. When
+  installed, an AP adapter is accessed by AP instructions executed by any CPU.
+
+  The AP adapter cards are assigned to a given LPAR via the system's Activation
+  Profile which can be edited via the HMC. When the system is IPL'd, the AP bus
+  module is loaded and detects the AP adapter cards assigned to the LPAR. The AP
+  bus creates a sysfs device for each adapter as they are detected. For example,
+  if AP adapters 4 and 10 (0x0a) are assigned to the LPAR, the AP bus will
+  create the following sysfs entries:
+
+    /sys/devices/ap/card04
+    /sys/devices/ap/card0a
+
+  Symbolic links to these devices will also be created in the AP bus devices
+  sub-directory:
+
+    /sys/bus/ap/devices/[card04]
+    /sys/bus/ap/devices/[card04]
+
+* AP domain
+
+  An adapter is partitioned into domains. Each domain can be thought of as
+  a set of hardware registers for processing AP instructions. An adapter can
+  hold up to 256 domains. Each domain is identified by a number from 0 to 255.
+  Domains can be further classified into two types:
+
+    * Usage domains are domains that can be accessed directly to process AP
+      commands.
+
+    * Control domains are domains that are accessed indirectly by AP
+      commands sent to a usage domain to control or change the domain; for
+      example, to set a secure private key for the domain.
+
+  The AP usage and control domains are assigned to a given LPAR via the system's
+  Activation Profile which can be edited via the HMC. When the system is IPL'd,
+  the AP bus module is loaded and detects the AP usage and control domains
+  assigned to the LPAR. The domain number of each usage domain will be coupled
+  with the adapter number of each AP adapter assigned to the LPAR to identify
+  the AP queues (see AP Queue section below). The domain number of each control
+  domain will be represented in a bitmask and stored in a sysfs file
+  /sys/bus/ap/ap_control_domain_mask created by the bus. The bits in the mask,
+  from most to least significant bit, correspond to domains 0-255.
+
+  A domain may be assigned to a system as both a usage and control domain, or
+  as a control domain only. Consequently, all domains assigned as both a usage
+  and control domain can both process AP commands as well as be changed by an AP
+  command sent to any usage domain assigned to the same system. Domains assigned
+  only as control domains can not process AP commands but can be changed by AP
+  commands sent to any usage domain assigned to the system.
+
+* AP Queue
+
+  An AP queue is the means by which an AP command-request message is sent to a
+  usage domain inside a specific adapter. An AP queue is identified by a tuple
+  comprised of an AP adapter ID (APID) and an AP queue index (APQI). The
+  APQI corresponds to a given usage domain number within the adapter. This tuple
+  forms an AP Queue Number (APQN) uniquely identifying an AP queue. AP
+  instructions include a field containing the APQN to identify the AP queue to
+  which the AP command-request message is to be sent for processing.
+
+  The AP bus will create a sysfs device for each APQN that can be derived from
+  the cross product of the AP adapter and usage domain numbers detected when the
+  AP bus module is loaded. For example, if adapters 4 and 10 (0x0a) and usage
+  domains 6 and 71 (0x47) are assigned to the LPAR, the AP bus will create the
+  following sysfs entries:
+
+    /sys/devices/ap/card04/04.0006
+    /sys/devices/ap/card04/04.0047
+    /sys/devices/ap/card0a/0a.0006
+    /sys/devices/ap/card0a/0a.0047
+
+  The following symbolic links to these devices will be created in the AP bus
+  devices subdirectory:
+
+    /sys/bus/ap/devices/[04.0006]
+    /sys/bus/ap/devices/[04.0047]
+    /sys/bus/ap/devices/[0a.0006]
+    /sys/bus/ap/devices/[0a.0047]
+
+* AP Instructions:
+
+  There are three AP instructions:
+
+  * NQAP: to enqueue an AP command-request message to a queue
+  * DQAP: to dequeue an AP command-reply message from a queue
+  * PQAP: to administer the queues
+
+AP and SIE:
+==========
+Let's now take a look at how AP instructions executed on a guest are interpreted
+by the hardware.
+
+A satellite control block called the Crypto Control Block (CRYCB) is attached to
+our main hardware virtualization control block. The CRYCB contains three fields
+to identify the adapters, usage domains and control domains assigned to the KVM
+guest:
+
+* The AP Mask (APM) field is a bit mask that identifies the AP adapters assigned
+  to the KVM guest. Each bit in the mask, from most significant to least
+  significant bit, corresponds to an APID from 0-255. If a bit is set, the
+  corresponding adapter is valid for use by the KVM guest.
+
+* The AP Queue Mask (AQM) field is a bit mask identifying the AP usage domains
+  assigned to the KVM guest. Each bit in the mask, from most significant to
+  least significant bit, corresponds to an AP queue index (APQI) from 0-255. If
+  a bit is set, the corresponding queue is valid for use by the KVM guest.
+
+* The AP Domain Mask field is a bit mask that identifies the AP control domains
+  assigned to the KVM guest. The ADM bit mask controls which domains can be
+  changed by an AP command-request message sent to a usage domain from the
+  guest. Each bit in the mask, from least significant to most significant bit,
+  corresponds to a domain from 0-255. If a bit is set, the corresponding domain
+  can be modified by an AP command-request message sent to a usage domain
+  configured for the KVM guest.
+
+If you recall from the description of an AP Queue, AP instructions include
+an APQN to identify the AP adapter and AP queue to which an AP command-request
+message is to be sent (NQAP and PQAP instructions), or from which a
+command-reply message is to be received (DQAP instruction). The validity of an
+APQN is defined by the matrix calculated from the APM and AQM; it is the
+cross product of all assigned adapter numbers (APM) with all assigned queue
+indexes (AQM). For example, if adapters 1 and 2 and usage domains 5 and 6 are
+assigned to a guest, the APQNs (1,5), (1,6), (2,5) and (2,6) will be valid for
+the guest.
+
+The APQNs can provide secure key functionality - i.e., a private key is stored
+on the adapter card for each of its domains - so each APQN must be assigned to
+at most one guest or to the linux host.
+
+   Example 1: Valid configuration:
+   ------------------------------
+   Guest1: adapters 1,2  domains 5,6
+   Guest2: adapter  1,2  domain 7
+
+   This is valid because both guests have a unique set of APQNs: Guest1 has
+   APQNs (1,5), (1,6), (2,5) and (2,6); Guest2 has APQNs (1,7) and (2,7).
+
+   Example 2: Invalid configuration:
+   Guest1: adapters 1,2  domains 5,6
+   Guest2: adapter  1    domains 6,7
+
+   This is an invalid configuration because both guests have access to
+   APQN (1,6).
+
+The Design:
+===========
+The design introduces three new objects:
+
+1. AP matrix device
+2. VFIO AP device driver (vfio_ap.ko)
+3. AP mediated matrix passthrough device
+
+The VFIO AP device driver
+-------------------------
+The VFIO AP (vfio_ap) device driver serves the following purposes:
+
+1. Provides the interfaces to bind APQNs for exclusive use of KVM guests.
+
+2. Sets up the VFIO mediated device interfaces to manage a mediated matrix
+   device and creates the sysfs interfaces for assigning adapters, usage
+   domains, and control domains comprising the matrix for a KVM guest.
+
+3. Configures the APM, AQM and ADM in the CRYCB referenced by a KVM guest's
+   SIE state description to grant the guest access to a matrix of AP devices
+
+Reserve APQNs for exclusive use of KVM guests
+---------------------------------------------
+The following block diagram illustrates the mechanism by which APQNs are
+reserved:

+                              +------------------+
+
+The process for reserving an AP queue for use by a KVM guest is:
+
+* The vfio-ap driver during its initialization will perform the following:
+  * Create a single 'vfio_ap' device, /sys/devices/virtual/misc/vfio_ap,
+    otherwise known as the matrix device.
+  * Register the matrix device with the device core
+* Register with the ap_bus for AP queue devices of type 10 (CEX4 and
+  newer) and to provide the vfio_ap driver's probe and remove callback
+  interfaces. Devices older than CEX4 queues are not supported to simplify the
+  implementation and because older devices will be going out of service in the
+  relatively near future.
+* The admin needs to unbind AP Queues to be reserved for use by guests from
+  the cex4queue device driver and bind them to the vfio_ap device driver.
+
+
+Set up the VFIO mediated device interfaces
+------------------------------------------
+The VFIO AP device driver utilizes the common interface of the VFIO mediated
+device core driver to:
+* Register an AP mediated bus driver to add a mediated matrix device to and
+  remove it from a VFIO group.
+* Create and destroy a mediated matrix device
+* Add a mediated matrix device to and remove it from the AP mediated bus driver
+* Add a mediated matrix device to and remove it from an IOMMU group
+
+The following high-level block diagram shows the main components and interfaces

+ +-------------+
+
+During initialization of the vfio_ap module, the matrix device is registered
+with an 'mdev_parent_ops' structure that provides the sysfs attribute
+structures, mdev functions and callback interfaces for managing the mediated
+matrix device.
+
+* sysfs attribute structures:
+  * supported_type_groups
+    The VFIO mediated device framework supports creation of user-defined
+    mediated device types. These mediated device types are specified
+    via the 'supported_type_groups' structure when a device is registered
+    with the mediated device framework. The registration process creates the
+    sysfs structures for each mediated device type specified in the
+    'mdev_supported_types' sub-directory of the device being registered. Along
+    with the device type, the sysfs attributes of the mediated device type are
+    provided.
+
+    The VFIO AP device driver will register one mediated device type for
+    passthrough devices:
+      /sys/devices/virtual/misc/vfio_ap/mdev_supported_types/vfio_ap-passthrough
+    Only the read-only attributes required by the VFIO mdev framework will
+    be provided:
+        ... name
+        ... device_api
+        ... available_instances
+        ... device_api
+        Where:
+        * name: specifies the name of the mediated device type
+        * device_api: the mediated device type's API
+        * available_instances: the number of mediated matrix passthrough devices
+                               that can be created
+        * device_api: specifies the VFIO API
+  * mdev_attr_groups
+    This attribute group identifies the user-defined sysfs attributes of the
+    mediated device. When a device is registered with the VFIO mediated device
+    framework, the sysfs attributes files identified in the 'mdev_attr_groups'
+    structure will be created in the mediated matrix device's directory. The
+    sysfs attributes for a mediated matrix device are:
+    * assign_adapter:
+    * unassign_adapter:
+      Write-only attributes for assigning/unassigning an AP adapter to/from the
+      mediated matrix device. To assign/unassign an adapter, the APID of the
+      adapter is written to the respective attribute file.
+    * assign_domain:
+    * unassign_domain:
+      Write-only attributes for assigning/unassigning an AP usage domain to/from
+      the mediated matrix device. To assign/unassign a domain, the APQI of the
+      AP queue corresponding to a usage domain is written to the respective
+      attribute file.
+    * matrix:
+      A read-only file for displaying the APQNs derived from the cross product
+      of the adapters and domains assigned to the mediated matrix device.
+    * assign_control_domain:
+    * unassign_control_domain:
+      Write-only attributes for assigning/unassigning an AP control domain
+      to/from the mediated matrix device. To assign/unassign a control domain,
+      the ID of a domain to be assigned/unassigned is written to the respective
+      attribute file.
+    * control_domains:
+      A read-only file for displaying the control domain numbers assigned to the
+      mediated matrix device.
+
+* functions:
+  * create:
+    allocates the ap_matrix_mdev structure used by the vfio_ap driver to:
+    * Store the reference to the KVM structure for the guest using the mdev
+    * Store the AP matrix configuration for the adapters, domains, and control
+      domains assigned via the corresponding sysfs attributes files
+  * remove:
+    deallocates the mediated matrix device's ap_matrix_mdev structure. This will
+    be allowed only if a running guest is not using the mdev.
+
+* callback interfaces
+  * open:
+    The vfio_ap driver uses this callback to register a
+    VFIO_GROUP_NOTIFY_SET_KVM notifier callback function for the mdev matrix
+    device. The open is invoked when QEMU connects the VFIO iommu group
+    for the mdev matrix device to the MDEV bus. Access to the KVM structure used
+    to configure the KVM guest is provided via this callback. The KVM structure,
+    is used to configure the guest's access to the AP matrix defined via the
+    mediated matrix device's sysfs attribute files.
+  * release:
+    unregisters the VFIO_GROUP_NOTIFY_SET_KVM notifier callback function for the
+    mdev matrix device and deconfigures the guest's AP matrix.
+
+Configure the APM, AQM and ADM in the CRYCB:
+-------------------------------------------
+Configuring the AP matrix for a KVM guest will be performed when the
+VFIO_GROUP_NOTIFY_SET_KVM notifier callback is invoked. The notifier
+function is called when QEMU connects to KVM. The CRYCB is configured by:
+* Setting the bits in the APM corresponding to the APIDs assigned to the
+  mediated matrix device via its 'assign_adapter' interface.
+* Setting the bits in the AQM corresponding to the APQIs assigned to the
+  mediated matrix device via its 'assign_domain' interface.
+* Setting the bits in the ADM corresponding to the domain dIDs assigned to the
+  mediated matrix device via its 'assign_control_domains' interface.
+
+The CPU model features for AP
+-----------------------------
+The AP stack relies on the presence of the AP instructions as well as two
+facilities: The AP Facilities Test (APFT) facility; and the AP Query
+Configuration Information (QCI) facility. These features/facilities are made
+available to a KVM guest via the following CPU model features:
+
+1. ap: Indicates whether the AP instructions are installed on the guest. This
+   feature will be enabled by KVM only if the AP instructions are installed
+   on the host.
+
+2. apft: Indicates the APFT facility is available on the guest. This facility
+   can be made available to the guest only if it is available on the host.
+
+3. apft: Indicates the AP QCI facility is available on the guest. This facility
+   can be made available to the guest only if it is available on the host.
+
+Note that if the user chooses to specify a CPU model different than the 'host'
+model to QEMU, the CPU model features and facilities need to be turned on
+explicitly; for example:
+
+     /usr/bin/qemu-system-s390x ... -cpu z13,ap=on,apqci=on,apft=on
+
+A guest can be precluded from using AP features/facilities by turning them off
+explicitly; for example:
+
+     /usr/bin/qemu-system-s390x ... -cpu host,ap=off,apqci=off,apft=off
+
+Example:
+=======
+Let's now provide an example to illustrate how KVM guests may be given
+access to AP facilities. For this example, we will show how to configure
+two guests such that executing the lszcrypt command on the guests would
+look like this:
+
+Guest1
+------
+CARD.DOMAIN TYPE  MODE
+------------------------------
+05          CEX5C CCA-Coproc
+05.0004     CEX5C CCA-Coproc
+05.00ab     CEX5C CCA-Coproc
+06          CEX5A Accelerator
+06.0004     CEX5A Accelerator
+06.00ab     CEX5C CCA-Coproc
+
+Guest2
+------
+CARD.DOMAIN TYPE  MODE
+------------------------------
+05          CEX5A Accelerator
+05.0047     CEX5A Accelerator
+05.00ff     CEX5A Accelerator
+
+These are the steps:
+
+1. Install the vfio_ap module on the linux host. The dependency chain for the
+   vfio_ap module is:
+   * vfio
+   * mdev
+   * vfio_mdev
+   * KVM
+   * vfio_ap
+
+2. Secure the AP queues to be used by the two guests so that the host can not
+   access them. Only type 10 adapters (i.e., CEX4 and later) are supported
+   for the following reasons: To simplify the implementation; a lack of older
+   systems on which to test; and because the older hardware will go out of
+   service in a relatively short time.
+
+   To secure the AP queues each, each AP Queue device must first be unbound from
+   the cex4queue device driver. The sysfs location of the driver is:
+
+   /sys/bus/ap
+   --- [drivers]
+   ------ [cex4queue]
+   --------- [05.0004]
+   --------- [05.0047]
+   --------- [05.00ab]
+   --------- [05.00ff]
+   --------- [06.0004]
+   --------- [06.00ab]
+   --------- unbind
+
+   To unbind AP queue 05.0004 for example;
+
+	echo 05.0004 > unbind
+
+   The AP queue devices must then be bound to the vfio_ap driver. The sysfs
+   location of the driver is:
+
+   /sys/bus/ap
+   --- [drivers]
+   ------ [cex4queue]
+   ---------- bind
+
+   To bind AP queue 05.0004 to the vfio_ap driver:
+
+	echo 05.0004 > bind
+
+   Take note that the AP queues bound to the vfio_ap driver will be available
+   for guest usage until the vfio_ap module is unloaded, or the host system is
+   shut down.
+
+3. Create the mediated devices needed to configure the AP matrixes for the
+   two guests and to provide an interface to the vfio_ap driver for
+   use by the guests:
+
+   /sys/devices/virtual/misc
+   --- [vfio_ap]
+   --------- [mdev_supported_types]
+   ------------ [vfio_ap-passthrough] (passthrough mediated matrix device type)
+   --------------- create
+   --------------- [devices]
+
+   To create the mediated devices for the two guests:
+
+	uuidgen > create
+	uuidgen > create
+
+   This will create two mediated devices in the [devices] subdirectory named
+   with the UUID written to the create attribute file. We call them $uuid1
+   and $uuid2:
+
+   /sys/devices/virtual/misc/
+   --- [vfio_ap]
+   --------- [mdev_supported_types]
+   ------------ [vfio_ap-passthrough]
+   --------------- [devices]
+   ------------------ [$uuid1]
+   --------------------- assign_adapter
+   --------------------- assign_control_domain
+   --------------------- assign_domain
+   --------------------- matrix
+   --------------------- unassign_adapter
+   --------------------- unassign_control_domain
+   --------------------- unassign_domain
+
+   ------------------ [$uuid2]
+   --------------------- assign_adapter
+   --------------------- assign_control_domain
+   --------------------- assign_domain
+   --------------------- matrix
+   --------------------- unassign_adapter
+   --------------------- unassign_control_domain
+   --------------------- unassign_domain
+
+4. The administrator now needs to configure the matrixes for mediated
+   devices $uuid1 (for Guest1) and $uuid2 (for Guest2).
+
+   This is how the matrix is configured for Guest1:
+
+   echo 5 > assign_adapter
+   echo 6 > assign_adapter
+   echo 4 > assign_domain
+   echo 0xab > assign_domain
+
+   For this implementation, all usage domains - i.e., domains assigned
+   via the assign_domain attribute file - will also be configured in the ADM
+   field of the KVM guest's CRYCB, so there is no need to assign control
+   domains here unless you want to assign control domains that are not
+   assigned as usage domains.
+
+   If a mistake is made configuring an adapter, domain or control domain,
+   you can use the unassign_xxx files to unassign the adapter, domain or
+   control domain.
+
+   To display the matrix configuration for Guest1:
+
+   cat matrix
+
+   This is how the matrix is configured for Guest2:
+
+   echo 5 > assign_adapter
+   echo 0x47 > assign_domain
+   echo 0xff > assign_domain
+
+   In order to successfully assign an adapter:
+
+   * All APQNs that can be derived from the adapter ID and the IDs of
+     the previously assigned domains must be bound to the vfio_ap device
+     driver. If no domains have yet been assigned, then there must be at least
+     one APQN with the specified APID bound to the vfio_ap driver.
+
+     No APQN that can be derived from the adapter ID and the IDs of the
+     previously assigned domains can be assigned to another mediated matrix
+     device.
+
+   In order to successfully assign a domain:
+
+   * All APQNs that can be derived from the domain ID and the IDs of
+     the previously assigned adapters must be bound to the vfio_ap device
+     driver. If no domains have yet been assigned, then there must be at least
+     one APQN with the specified APQI bound to the vfio_ap driver.
+
+     No APQN that can be derived from the domain ID and the IDs of the
+     previously assigned adapters can be assigned to another mediated matrix
+     device.
+
+5. Start Guest1:
+
+   /usr/bin/qemu-system-s390x ... -cpu xxx,ap=on,apqci=on,apft=on \
+      -device vfio-ap,sysfsdev=/sys/devices/virtual/misc/vfio_ap/$uuid1 ...
+
+7. Start Guest2:
+
+   /usr/bin/qemu-system-s390x ... -cpu xxx,ap=on,apqci=on,apft=on \
+      -device vfio-ap,sysfsdev=/sys/devices/virtual/misc/vfio_ap/$uuid2 ...
+
+When the guest is shut down, the mediated matrix device may be removed.
+
+Using our example again, to remove the mediated matrix device $uuid1:
+
+   /sys/devices/virtual/misc
+      --- [vfio_ap]
+      --------- [mdev_supported_types]
+      ------------ [vfio_ap-passthrough]
+      --------------- [devices]
+      ------------------ [$uuid1]
+      --------------------- remove
+
+
+   echo 1 > remove
+
+   This will release all the AP queues configured for the mediated device and
+   remove all of the mdev matrix device's sysfs structures including the mdev
+   device itself. To recreate and reconfigure the mdev matrix device, all of the
+   steps starting with step 3 will have to be performed again. Note that the
+   remove will fail if a guest using the mdev is still running.
+
+   It is not necessary to remove an mdev matrix device, but one may want to
+   remove it if no guest will use it during the lifetime of the linux host. If
+   the mdev matrix device is removed, one may want to unbind the AP queues the
+   guest was using from the vfio_ap device driver and bind them back to the
+   default driver. Alternatively, the AP queues can be configured for another
+   mdev matrix (i.e., guest).
+
+
+Limitations
+===========
+* The KVM/kernel interfaces do not provide a way to prevent unbinding an AP
+  queue that is still assigned to a mediated device. Even if the device
+  'remove' callback returns an error, the device core detaches the AP
+  queue from the VFIO AP driver. It is therefore incumbent upon the
+  administrator to make sure there is no mediated device to which the
+  APQN - for the AP queue being unbound - is assigned.
+
+* Hot plug/unplug of AP devices is not supported for guests.
+
+* Live guest migration is not supported for guests using AP devices.
