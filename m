Please re-read what I wrote.  Here I'm talking about the crypto code itself, not
its users.

And you still haven't answered my question about adding a new algorithm that is
useful to have in both APIs.  You're proposing that in most cases the crypto API
part will need to go through Herbert while the implementation will need to go
through you/Greg, right?  Or will you/Greg be taking both?  Or will Herbert take
both?

A documentation file for Zinc is a good idea.  Some of the information in your
commit messages should be moved there too.

I'm not trying to "politicize" this, but rather determine your criteria for
including algorithms in Zinc, which you haven't made clear.  Since for the
second time you've avoided answering my question about whether you'd allow the
SM4 cipher in Zinc, and you designed WireGuard to be "cryptographically
opinionated", and you were one of the loudest voices calling for the Speck
cipher to be removed, and your justification for Zinc complains about cipher
modes from "90s cryptographers", I think it's reasonable for people to wonder
whether as the Zinc (i.e. Linux crypto library) maintainer you will restrict the
inclusion of crypto algorithms to the ones you prefer, rather than the ones that
users need.  Note that the kernel is used by people all over the world and needs
to support various standards, protocols, and APIs that use different crypto
algorithms, not always the ones we'd like; and different users have different
preferences.  People need to know whether the Linux kernel's crypto library will
meet (or be allowed to meet) their crypto needs.

IOW, you had to rewrite the x86 assembly algorithm in C and make it use a
different Poly1305 context format.  That's a major change, where bugs can be
introduced -- and at least one was introduced, in fact.  I'd appreciate it if
you were more accurate in describing your modifications and the potential risks
involved.

And yes I know why converting radixes is needed, as I had pointed it out...

Please prefer to put information in the code or documentation rather than in
commit messages, when appropriate.

No, I was not aware of the fixed version.  I found the bug myself reading the
latest patchset you've mailed out, v6.  It's great that you found and fixed this
bug on your own, and of course that raises my level of confidence in your work.
Still, the v6 patchset still includes your claim that "All implementations have
been extensively tested and fuzzed"; so that claim was objectively wrong.  So I
disagree that my concerns are "complete and utter garbage".  And I think that
the fact that you prefer to respond by attacking me, rather than committing to
be more accurate in your claims and to treat all contributions fairly, is
problematic.

Also, if you have extra tests that you're running, it would be great if you
could include them as part of the submission so that others can run them too.

Well, it doesn't help that you yourself claim that Zinc stands for
"Zx2c4's INsane Cryptolib"...
