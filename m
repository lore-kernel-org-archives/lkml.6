Well, this has been the case since I remember. ~__GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM
resp. GFP_NOWAIT formerly meant that the allocation doesn't perform
_any_ reclaim and therefore it never retries. Why would it? Any retry
would just hope for a reclaim on behalf of somebody else. __GFP_NORETRY
has always simply stopped retrying after one/few reclaim attempts.
Implementation has changed here and there over time but in essence the
semantic remained the same. Please have a look at the current
documentation in gfp.h file and let me know if you would like some
clarfications.

Do you have any specific areas to look at?

I will have a look at it. Thanks!
