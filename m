It should, since I formulated the reasoning behind that viewpoint 
directly from the model.  The basic idea is this:

	By induction, show that whenever we have A ->rcu-fence B then
	anything po-before A executes before anything po-after B, and
	furthermore, any write which propagates to A's CPU before A
	executes will propagate to every CPU before B finishes (i.e.,
	before anything po-after B executes).

	Using this, show that whenever X ->rb Y holds then X must
	execute before Y.

That's what the 6-CPU argument did.  In that litmus test we have
mb2 ->rcu-fence mb23, Rc ->rb Re, mb1 ->rcu-fence mb14, Rb ->rb Rf,
mb0 ->rcu-fence mb05, and lastly Ra ->rb Ra.  The last one is what 
shows that the test is forbidden.

Imagine that each sys_membarrier call takes a fixed duration and each 
other instruction takes slightly less (the idea being that each 
instruction is a critical section).  Instructions can be reordered 
(although not across a sys_membarrier call), but no matter how the 
reordering is done, the result is disallowed.

Why not?  They are both synchronization mechanisms with heavy-weight
write sides and light-weight read sides, and most importantly, they
provide the same Guarantee.
