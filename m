To make the things clear, can you show me, if possible, the followings:
* dmesg
* /proc/iomem
* the output from "kexec -d", particularly the last part like
    kexec_load: entry = 0x411d7660 flags = 0xb70000
    nr_segments = 3
    segment[0].buf   = 0xffff86613010
    segment[0].bufsz = 0x10e9b48
    segment[0].mem   = 0x40080000
    segment[0].memsz = 0x1156000
    segment[1].buf   = 0xffff86211010
    segment[1].bufsz = 0x20e
    segment[1].mem   = 0x411d6000
    segment[1].memsz = 0x1000
    segment[2].buf   = 0x5045420
    segment[2].bufsz = 0x31b8
    segment[2].mem   = 0x411d7000
    segment[2].memsz = 0x4000
