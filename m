Sorry for the late response to this.

I think I'm generally on-board with this.  I admit I'm a little
hesitant about adding 200 lines of code when this is really more
"cleanup" than new functionality, but I think a lot of that is because
this series contains costs (e.g., duplicating code) for everybody but
only has the corresponding benefits for a few (ACPI, x86, xenfront).
Those cases are much closer to parity in terms of lines added/removed.

I saw some minor comments that suggested you had some updates, so I'll
watch for an updated posting.

Bjorn
