No, but I agree it looks totally nonsensical.  I tried to pull out the
hardware ASPM settings from all your lspci info (thanks very much for
collecting all that).  Here's what I got.  The same/disabled comments
are relative to the "default" baseline:

                                default,      force       force             force     default      pcie_aspm=off  force pwrsave
                              pcie_aspm=off   default   performance        powersave  after resume  after resume  after resume
  notes                                                                               [1,2,3]       [1,2,3,5]     [1,2,3,4,5]

I haven't made sense out of any of this yet, except that the "force
performance" column seems plausible: if we want performance, we should
disable ASPM across the board.

I don't really know where to start here.  Maybe we can focus on
understanding one tiny piece.  Can you apply the following patch and
try just the "force powersave" situation?  Please collect the entire
dmesg log and "lspci -vv" output.
