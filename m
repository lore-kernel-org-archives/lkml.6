In the case of happycache, this isn't the database doing the
dump/restore, but a separate process that could have the cap - it's
better if we can do without though, and from his readme he runs as user
cassandra in the /var/lib/cassandra directory for example so that'd
match the file owner.

For pgfincore, it's a postgres extension so the main process does it -
but it does have files open as write as well as being the owner.

I agree with that. 
"Being owner or has cap" (whichever cap) is probably OK.
On the other hand, writeability check makes more sense in general -
could we somehow check if the user has write access to the file instead
of checking if it currently is opened read-write?
