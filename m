I believe that the problem stems from these drivers being used for some 
wireless AP functionality built into some MIPS based SoCs. The Kconfig 
rules sort out building this additional functionality when configured 
for MIPS (in a round about sort of way), but it allowed it even when SSB 
is a module, leading to build failures. My patch was intended to prevent 
that.

There was a similar issue in the same Kconfig file, introduced by 
c5611df96804 and fixed by a9e6d44ddecc. It was fixed the same way as you 
suggest. I've tested the above patch and it does work for MIPS 
(preventing the PCICORE being built into the module).

Thanks & sorry again for the breakage,
Matt
