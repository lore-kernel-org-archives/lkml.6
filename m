Hmm, quite a long Cc list, but ok.

Not sure what you mean with hw signing support here, they support UEFI

Ok, I will add some docs for v2 of the patch.

If things are compromised before the kernel boots no amount of
checks are going to help us, an attacker can then just boot an entirely
different kernel, rather then attacking the system through a backdoored
firmware, so a CRC should be fine. Either way I'm happy to switch to a
crypto hash, but the crypto subsystem is not initialized yet at this
point AFAICT, so using a CRC is easier.

Right, I agree that using a new Kconfig entry for this is a good idea,
thinking more about that we can even make it a hidden option and
have the drivers which need this do a "select EFI_EMBEDDED_FIRMWARE",
if we're going to require a special flag during loading of the firmware,
then I think having the drivers also control the Kconfig option make
sense.

They are all around 40k, so quite small.

As the maintainer of that 1 upstream driver (soon to be 2 I submitted
the other driver a couple of days ago) which uses this, I'm fine with the
EFI fallback replacing the userspace-helper fallback path.

So thinking more about this, I agree that this needs to be driver driven,
for the silead touchscreens we have:

drivers/platform/x86/silead_dmi.c

Which contains touchscreen parameters such as x and y coordinate ranges
and touchscreen orientation vs lcd-panel orientation, as well as a
per model firmware filename as the firmware is model-specific.

It makes a lot of sense to also add embedded firmware info in the
very same dmi_system_id table, this can simply be done by making the
data pointed to by the dmi_system_id.driver_data member always
start with a struct embedded_fw_desc. Then the efi embedded firmware
code can use the same table.

The chipone-icn8505 touchscreens don't need any of the mentioned
parameters, there is an ACPI method (_SUB) to get a string which
should uniquely identify the needed firmware file and the other info
can be read back from the hardware after loading the firmware, but
we can still use the same mechanism there.

So my plan for v2 is to:
-rename silead_dmi to touchscreen_dmi (and also use it for chipone info)
-have the TOUCHSCREEN_DMI Kconfig option select EFI_EMBEDDED_FIRMWARE
-inside drivers/firmware/efi/embedded-firmware.c, have:

static const struct * const dmi_system_id embedded_fw_table[] = {
#ifdef CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_DMI
	touchscreen_dmi_table,
#endif
	NULL
};

With the idea that in the future it may become:

static const struct * const dmi_system_id embedded_fw_table[] = {
#ifdef CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_DMI
	touchscreen_dmi_table,
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_DRIVER_FOOBAR
	driver_foobar_dmi_table,
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_DRIVER_BARFOO
	driver_foobar_dmi_table,
#endif
	NULL
};

This means one commit touching drivers/firmware/efi/embedded-firmware.c
each time a new driver starts using EFI embedded firmware, but I think
that will be quite rare and if I turn out to be wrong we can always
do something more fancy later.

I will switch to kmemdup for v2. The memory usage will be the same as we
can then omit the efi_mem_reserve() call and the original copy will get
freed.

Ok, time for me to start working on a v2, based on the latest driver-core/next
code, adding all the discussed changes as well as adding a bunch of documentation.
