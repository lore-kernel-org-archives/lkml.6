Yes, adding a new address space is easy (and doesn't need any modification
to sparse). Here, I think adding a new 'modifier' __tagged (much like
__nocast, __noderef, ...) would be much more appropriate.
I think that at this point, it would be nice to have a clear description
of the problem and what sort of checks are wanted.

That would be, indeed, a simple solution but IMO even more dangerous than
__force itself (since by readingthe code with this annotation  people would 
naturally think it only involves the AS will in fact it would be the same
as __force). I prefer to directly implement a plain __force_as, forcing
only the AS).

I think that the if (Wcast_from_as) is unneeded, the <asn:%d> can be added
even if Wcast_from_as is false. Woukd it be OK for you?
