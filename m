Hi Bjorn,

Thank you for more insight you have given about the problem.

For us the issue comes before we disable apst feature.
on APST quirk set, NVMe driver disable apst by send a command to NVMe
controller.
We see issue at the time of NVMe initialization only.

So APST quirk did not helped.

we are at evolution stage so we need to fix this ASAP.
As you said earlier, Can I add sysfs interface to enable LTR same as
we do L1SS or in the part of aspm cap init function.
