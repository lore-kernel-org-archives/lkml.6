I guess...

Well, I'm still hoping to have this wonderful and reliable
logging facility one day where we can dump bytes into a
persistent-across-reboots buffer and analyze them later. And yap, in
that case, I don't mind if the code simply bypasses all the dancing in
the OS and writes those bytes. Even switching pagetables would be too
much for that case - just fire'n'forget writing from ring 0.
