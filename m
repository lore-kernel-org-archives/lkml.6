You should say something here about what happens if userspace
tries to use both KVM_VGIC_V3_ADDR_TYPE_REDIST_REGION and
KVM_VGIC_V3_ADDR_TYPE_REDIST. I think this should be an error
(reported by whichever of the two you try to set second).

If you're not using the bits for anything else you want to
check they're 0 anyway. Otherwise we can't guarantee to safely
use them for something else in future, because userspace might
be handing us garbage in those bits without noticing.
