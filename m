Subject: [PATCH v2 00/15] crypto: improved skcipher, aead, and hash tests
Date:   Thu, 31 Jan 2019 23:51:35 -0800

Hello,

Crypto algorithms must produce the same output for the same input
regardless of data layout, i.e. how the src and dst scatterlists are
divided into chunks and how each chunk is aligned.  Request flags such
as CRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_SLEEP must not affect the result either.

However, testing of this currently has many gaps.  For example,
individual algorithms are responsible for providing their own chunked
test vectors.  But many don't bother to do this or test only one or two
cases, providing poor test coverage.  Also, other things such as buffers
spanning a page boundary, misaligned IVs, and CRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_SLEEP
are never tested at all.

Test code is also duplicated between the chunked and non-chunked cases,
making it difficult to make other improvements.

To improve the situation, this patch series basically moves the chunk
descriptions into the testmgr itself so that they are shared by all
algorithms.  However, it's done in an extensible way via a new struct
'testvec_config', which describes not just the scaled chunk lengths but
also all other aspects of the crypto operation besides the data itself
such as the buffer alignments, the request flags, whether the operation
is in-place or not, the IV alignment, and for hash algorithms when to do
each update() and when to use finup() vs. final() vs. digest().

Then, this patch series makes skcipher, aead, and hash algorithms be
tested against a list of default testvec_configs, replacing the current
test code.  This improves overall test coverage, without reducing test
performance too much.  Note that the test vectors themselves are not
changed, except for removing the chunk lists.

This series also adds randomized fuzz tests, enabled by a new kconfig
option intended for developer use only, where skcipher, aead, and hash
algorithms are tested against many randomly generated testvec_configs.
This provides much more comprehensive test coverage.

I've run these improved tests on x86, arm32, and arm64 with all crypto
algorithms enabled, and they have already found many bugs.  Patches 1-7
and the patches from Ard Biesheuvel fix most of the bugs found so far.
A bug was also detected in the Rockchip crypto driver which remains to
be fixed.  Also many AEADs incorrectly change aead_request::base.tfm,
but for now I'm temporarily working around that in the tests as I plan
to fix it later after the other types of bugs are addressed.

If anyone reading this has access to systems with other architectures or
crypto drivers that may not have been tested yet, you can help by
applying these patches on your system, enabling
CONFIG_CRYPTO_MANAGER_EXTRA_TESTS, and reporting or fixing any test
failures.

This patch series can also be found in git at
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ebiggers/linux.git
branch "testmgr-improvements".

Changed since v1:

- Made CONFIG_CRYPTO_MANAGER_EXTRA_TESTS depend on CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL.
- Improved commit description of AEGIS and MORUS fixes.
- A few very minor cleanups to the test code.
