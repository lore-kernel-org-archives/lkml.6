I would not say it should include PCIe slots but there are other cables
that carry PCIe and I was thinking we could make it to support those as
well.

I have no problem using is_thunderbolt here, though if we don't want to
support non-Thunderbolt external devices this way.

However, the question here is more that where I should put the _DSD
parsing code if it is not suitable to be placed inside PCI/ACPI core as
I've done in this patch? ;-)
