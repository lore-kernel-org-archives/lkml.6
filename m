My fd/inode knowledge is lacking, to say the least.  Whatever works, so
long as we have a way to uniquely identify enclaves.

Adding pages via workqueue makes the ioctl itself fast enough to avoid
triggering Go's rescheduling.  A batched EADD flow would likely help,
I just haven't had the time to rework the userspace side to be able to
test the performance.

It's the latter, a cgroup to limit EPC.  The mm is used to retrieve the
cgroup without having track e.g. the task_struct.
