I don't remember the reliability issue.  Was that in a previous
conversation?  AFAICT, using current_link_speed and current_link_width
should be as reliable as pcie_bandwidth_available() because they're
both based on reading PCI_EXP_LNKSTA.

This patch exposes only the available bandwidth, not the limiting
device, link speed, or link width.  Maybe that extra information isn't
important in this context.  Of course, it's easy to derive using
current_link_speed and current_link_width, but if we do that, there's
really no benefit to adding a new file.

Linux doesn't really support Virtual Channels (VC) yet, and I don't
know much about it, but it seems like Quality-of-Service features like
VC could affect this idea of available bandwidth.

Since we already expose the necessary information, and we might throw
additional things like VC into the mix, I'm a little hesitant about
adding things to sysfs because they're very difficult to change later.
