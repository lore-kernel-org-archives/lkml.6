Hi Szabolcs,

Thanks for looking into this. Comments below.

I don't think turning TBI0 off is critical (it's handy for PAC with
52-bit VA but then it's short-lived if you want more security features
like MTE).

I think MTE HWCAP should imply it.

We could enable it via prctl. That's the plan for MTE as well (in
addition maybe to some ELF flag).

The AT_FLAGS is aimed at capturing binary 2 case above, i.e. the
relaxation of the syscall ABI to accept tb = any. The MTE support will
have its own AT_HWCAP, likely in addition to AT_FLAGS. Arguably,
AT_FLAGS is either redundant here if MTE implies it (and no harm in
keeping it around) or the meaning is different: a tb != 0 may be checked
by the kernel against the allocation tag (i.e. get_user() could fail,
the tag is not entirely ignored).

> the discussion here was mostly about binary 2,

That's because passing tb != 0 into the syscall ABI is the main blocker
here that needs clearing out before merging the MTE support. There is,
of course, a variation of binary 1 for MTE:

binary 5: user tb = mte, syscall tb = 0

but this requires a lot of C lib changes to support properly.

If we ignore binary 3, we can keep TBI0 = 1 permanently, whether we have
MTE or not.

We've been trying to track these down since last summer and we came to
the conclusion that it should be (mostly) fine for the non-weird memory
described above.
