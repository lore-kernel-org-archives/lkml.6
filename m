And that's really wrong. P+A is a state where the interrupt is still
being processed. The only case where we can reliably detect that an
interrupt has been EOId is when state==0.

The EOI bit indicates that we've requested a maintenance interrupt from
the HW. It only triggers when state==0. If you have (like you describe
further down) a sequence of

P -> A -> (exit) -> P+A -> P -> A -> (exit) P+A ...

we can never reliably detect that an interrupt has been EOId (because
the HW never delivers a maintenance interrupt), other than by tracking
the states before and after exit, and hoping that you've done an exit
because you're touching the source of the interrupt.

Thanks. I'll have a look.

Yeah, that approach doesn't work. I'll try and come up with another
approach (basically banning P+A for interrupts that require a back
notification).

So the line is never lowered. That's very odd.

Which is really bizarre. The device only lowers the line when it is
being told that the interrupt has been processed. That really smells of
a bug in the device emulation. It should be lowered when the guest
clears the interrupt status at the device level, and not when notified
that the interrupt has been completed at the interrupt controller level.

Thanks,
