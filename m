I don't want to do that, I want to work on a single bvec at a time like
the current implementation does.

we'd need some indication that we need to reinit my iter with the
new bvec, today we do:

static inline void nvme_tcp_advance_req(struct nvme_tcp_request *req,
                 int len)
{
         req->snd.data_sent += len;
         req->pdu_sent += len;
         iov_iter_advance(&req->snd.iter, len);
         if (!iov_iter_count(&req->snd.iter) &&
             req->snd.data_sent < req->data_len) {
                 req->snd.curr_bio = req->snd.curr_bio->bi_next;
                 nvme_tcp_init_send_iter(req);
         }
}

and initialize the send iter. I imagine that now I will need to
switch to the next bvec and only if I'm on the last I need to
use the next bio...

Do you offer an API for that?

Does bvec_iter span bvecs with your patches? I didn't see that change?

But I don't need this iteration, I need a transparent API like;
bvec2 = rq_bvec_next(rq, bvec)

This way I can simply always reinit my iter without thinking about how
the request/bios/bvecs are constructed...

Still not very useful given that I don't want to use a table...

They are pretty much listed above. Today nvme-tcp sets an iterator with:

vec = __bvec_iter_bvec(bio->bi_io_vec, bio->bi_iter);
nsegs = bio_segments(bio);
size = bio->bi_iter.bi_size;
offset = bio->bi_iter.bi_bvec_done;
iov_iter_bvec(&req->snd.iter, WRITE, vec, nsegs, size);

and when done, iterate to the next bio and do the same.

With multipage bvec it would be great if we can simply have
something like rq_bvec_next() that would pretty much satisfy
the requirements from the nvme-tcp side...
