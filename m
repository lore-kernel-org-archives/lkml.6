No, in both we set it per the rotational parameters of the disk in 

sd.c:sd_read_block_characteristics()

	rot = get_unaligned_be16(&buffer[4]);

	if (rot == 1) {
	
	blk_queue_flag_set(QUEUE_FLAG_NONROT, q);
	
	blk_queue_flag_clear(QUEUE_FLAG_ADD_RANDOM, q);
	} else {
	
	blk_queue_flag_clear(QUEUE_FLAG_NONROT, q);
	
	blk_queue_flag_set(QUEUE_FLAG_ADD_RANDOM, q);
	}


That check wasn't changed by the code removal.

Although I suspect it should be unconditional: even SSDs have what
would appear as seek latencies at least during writes depending on the
time taken to find an erased block or even trigger garbage collection. 
The entropy collector is good at taking something completely regular
and spotting the inconsistencies, so it won't matter that loads of
"seeks" are deterministic.
