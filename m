True that's a good point.

For omap3, the properties for "ti,twl4030-power-idle" or
"ti,twl4030-power-idle-osc-off" mean just that.

The PMIC is wired and configured for off mode, and those
properties should not be set unless the system is truly capable
of entering off mode. If not set, we should not enable off
idle by default.

Otherwise the boards should be already using just
"ti,twl4030-power" or "ti,twl4030-power-reset".

So it should be safe to set a flag for off_mode based
on that flag during boot, or set a flag for off
mode allowed if the flag is needed later on.

Regards,

Tony
