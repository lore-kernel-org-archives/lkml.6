The compiler fundamentally can't. At the very least it would require
effective type tracking, which requires shadow memory and is even more
controversial than -fstrict-aliasing (because in a sense it's a
stronger version thereof). But even effective type tracking would not
help, since you can have things like:

	struct iovec *iov = malloc(sizeof *iov);
	scanf("%p %zu", &iov->iov_base, &iov->iov_len);

where no store to the object via the struct type ever happens and the
only stores that do happen are invisible across translation unit
boundaries. (Ignore that scanf here is awful; it's just a canonical
example of a function that would store the members via pointers to
them.)

The kernel-side approach could work if the kernel had some markup for
fields that need to be zero- or sign-extended when copied from user in
a 32-bit process and applied them at copy time. That could also fix
the existing tv_nsec issue. I'm not sure how difficult/costly it would
be though.
