I'm aware how that hw-queue stuff works. But that only works if the
spreading algorithm makes the interrupts affine to offline/not-present CPUs
when the block device is initialized.

In the example above:

and assumed that at driver init time only CPU 0-3 are online then the
hotplug of CPU 4-7 will not result in any interrupt delivered to CPU 4-7.

So the extra assignment to CPU 4-7 in the affinity mask has no effect
whatsoever and even if the spreading result is 'perfect' it just looks
perfect as it is not making any difference versus the original result:
