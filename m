Thank you for introducing RFC patches.
I saw the legacy interrupt part of them and I think that these became easier
to reference. Especially irq_domain_ops.map() will be the same.

Currently candidate pcie-uniphier driver and some ones are assuming to take
an interrupt from "interrupts" property because of using single interrupt.

	interrupt-name = "intx";
	interrupts = <xxx>;

However, keystone has 4 interrupts and Kishon's patch is assuming
to take it from the property in child "legacy-interrupt-controller" node.
Maybe latter is more general and I can apply it.

	legacy-interrupt-controller {
		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <1>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
		interrupts = <xxx>;
	};

I'll send v3 patch with reference to these RFC patches for now.

Thank you,
