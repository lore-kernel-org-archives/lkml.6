Subject: B43 driver no longer works in Linux 4.15 (bisected)

In the time between Linux 4.15-rc8 and -rc9, my wireless driver, b43,
would no longer load automatically. When I modprobe the b43 (and ssb)
modules, the device still didn't appear in NetworkManager. Comparing
the kernel logs between working (4.14.16-lts) and nonworking (4.15)
kernels reveals that there is zero output from the ssb module, and no
devices recognized by the b43 driver:

Compare:

working:

vs nonworking, with manual modprobe:

 kernel: platform regulatory.0: Direct firmware load for regulatory.db
failed with error -2
 kernel: cfg80211: failed to load regulatory.db
 kernel: Broadcom 43xx driver loaded [ Features: NLS ]

I had my suspicions at this point, but I had a lull and decided to
bisect it anyways.
I bisected to this "first bad commit:"

commit 58eae1416b804d900014d84feadda7195007cc30
Author: James Hogan <jhogan@kernel.org>

    ssb: Disable PCI host for PCI_DRIVERS_GENERIC

    Since commit d41e6858ba58 ("MIPS: Kconfig: Set default MIPS system type
    as generic") changed the default MIPS platform to the "generic"
    platform, which uses PCI_DRIVERS_GENERIC instead of PCI_DRIVERS_LEGACY,
    various files in drivers/ssb/ have failed to build.

    This is particularly due to the existence of struct pci_controller being
    dependent on PCI_DRIVERS_LEGACY since commit c5611df96804 ("MIPS: PCI:
    Introduce CONFIG_PCI_DRIVERS_LEGACY"), so add that dependency to Kconfig
    to prevent these files being built for the "generic" platform including
    all{yes,mod}config builds.

Since it was just a one-line Kconfig change, i investigated further,
and noted how a dependency change affects the build:

 missing config: SSB_B43_PCI_BRIDGE
 caused by missing dependency config: SSB_PCIHOST_POSSIBLE
 disabling pseudo-config: B43_PCI_AUTOSELECT

 also missing config: CONFIG_SSB_DRIVER_PCICORE
 caused by missing dependency config: SSB_DRIVER_PCICORE_POSSIBLE
 which is missing because of missing dependency config: SSB_PCIHOST
 which is missing because of missing dependency config: SSB_PCIHOST_POSSIBLE
 disabling pseudo-config: B43_PCICORE_AUTOSELECT

The responsible config SSB_PCIHOST_POSSIBLE was disabled because
PCI_DRIVERS_LEGACY is not enabled. The PCI_DRIVERS_LEGACY config
dependency was added by the "bad" commit, which was apparently made to
fix build errors that resulted from a change a year ago. The problem,
as far as I can tell, is that the PCI_DRIVERS_LEGACY config is meant
to enable a MIPS-only API, but then it also disables building for
hardware that is not exclusive to MIPS, thus disabling my driver.

A solution would be to revert that commit, but the commit/kconfig
needs to be fixed....

Anyways, here is my device details from the working kernel, from the
output of lspci -vv

Anyways, if it's relevant, those kernels are from Arch Linux.

Hopefully this isn't caught by spam filters this time... Sorry if it
sends twice.
