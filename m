I didn't suggest this as the way of implementing fine-grained
randomization but rather a small starting point for hardening address
space layout further. I don't think it should be tied to a mmap flag
but rather something like a personality flag or a global sysctl. It
doesn't need to be random at all to be valuable, and it's just a first
step. It doesn't mean there can't be switches between random pivots
like OpenBSD mmap, etc. I'm not so sure that randomly switching around
is going to result in isolating things very well though.

The VMA count issue is at least something very predictable with a
performance cost only for kernel operations.

That's not what I said. I was saying that splitting things into
regions based on the type of allocation works really well and allows
for high entropy bases, but that the kernel can't really do that right
now. It could split up code that starts as PROT_EXEC into a region but
that's generally not how libraries are mapped in so it won't know
until mprotect which is obviously too late. Unless it had some kind of
type key passed from userspace, it can't really do that.

Starting with fairly aggressive fragmentation of the address space is
going to be a really hard sell. The costs of a very spread out address
space in terms of TLB misses, etc. are unclear. Starting with enforced
gaps (1 page) and randomization for those wouldn't rule out having
finer-grained randomization, like randomly switching between different
regions. This needs to be cheap enough that people want to enable it,
and the goals need to be clearly spelled out. The goal needs to be
clearer than "more randomization =3D=3D good" and then accepting a high
performance cost for that.

I'm not dictating how things should be done, I don't have any say
about that. I'm just trying to discuss it.
