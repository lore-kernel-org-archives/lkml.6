The code I posted had a few typos (stupid AT&T syntax), but with those
fixed the idea checks out.

My initial reaction to a barebones ABI was that it would be a
"documentation nightmare", but it's not too bad if it returns actual
error codes and fills in a struct on exceptions instead of stuffing
registers.  And with the MXCSR/FCW issues it might actually be less
documentation in the long run since we can simply say that all state
is the caller's responsibility.

I *really* like that we basically eliminate bikeshedding on which GPRs
to pass to/from the enclave.
