Yes i need to document that some more in hmm.txt, PRIVATE is for device
that have memory that do not fit regular memory expectation ie cachable
so PCIe device memory fit under that category. So if all you need is
struct page for such memory then this is a perfect fit. On top of that
you can use more HMM feature, like using this memory transparently
inside a process address space.

PUBLIC is for memory that belong to a device but still can be access by
CPU in cache coherent way (CAPI, CCIX, ...). Again if you have such
memory and just want struct page you can use that and again if you want
to use that inside a process address space HMM provide more helpers to
do so.

I am about to send RFC for nouveau, i am still working out some bugs.
I was hoping to be done today but i am still fighting with the hardware.
They are other drivers being work on with HMM. I do not know exactly
when they will be made public (i expect in coming months).

How you use HMM is under the control of the device driver, as well as
how you expose it to userspace. They use it how they want to use it.
There is no pattern or requirement imposed by HMM. All driver being work
on so far are GPU like hardware, ie big chunk of on board memory
(several giga-bytes) and they want to use that memory inside process
address space in a transparent fashion to the program and CPU.

Each have their own API expose to userspace and while they are a lot of
similarity among them, lot of details of userspace API is hardware
specific. In GPU world most of the driver are in userspace, application
do target high level API such as OpenGL, Vulkan, OpenCL or CUDA. Those
API then have a hardware specific userspace driver that talks to hardware
specific IOCTL. So this is not like network or block device.

I have couple small fixes/typo patches that i need to cleanup and send
i will fix the MAINTAINERS as part of those.
