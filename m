Never heard of this tool, but we haven't followed this discussion for =
years since
we never had problems with "ham1-everywhere". What I am not completely =
sure is if
ubifs is using its own ECC scheme or not. If it is (like I assume), the =
user-space
partition is independent of this setting and we just have discussion for =
MLO/U-Boot
and kernel partitions.

So I think it boils down to the question if
a) upstream should do a suboptimal thing, but be compatible to the =
current vendor kernel and u-boot
b) upstream should do the right thing, but stay incompatible

Result of b) would e.g. a stock Debian kernel will not be able to read =
or write the partitions of a device
created with vendor kernel.

And even worse, it is not clear if users will want to erase and reflash =
the NAND to match what kernel.org defines if they have a running system.

This makes me believe that a) is still better for practical reasons, =
even if technically worse.

BR,
Nikolaus
