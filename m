What would the use case for unprivileged i.e. this configuration would
mean depending on permissions?

There would be three types of users:

1. Ones that have access to neither of the devices.
2. Ones that have access to unprivileged. Who are these?
3. Ones that have access to provisioning.

ATM the launch enclave bit is disallowed by the kernel in the current
patch set. I don't really see any use case to allow them except if we
want to allow run enclaves in an environment where the MSRs are rdonly.
