Yes, when sending the data to ieee80211_is_action() it should pass
16bit value instead of 8bit value. It should be corrected.

But the buff received from the wifi module is already in little endian
format. As the data is already in LE endian format so in my opinion
the conversion is not required while calling ieee80211_is_action().

The buffer structure contains both some custom information along
with standard info. As the frame_control is the first 2 byte in the in
buff so casting it can also help to extract frame_control.

Please refer the code in mgmt_tx() which use like below

const struct ieee80211_mgmt *mgmt;
....
mgmt = (const struct ieee80211_mgmt *)buf;

ieee80211_is_action(mgmt->frame_control)


I think another approach can be by using proper type cast with first 2
bytes of buffer(to extract 16bit value) and pass it to
ieee80211_is_action().
