Ah! Nice. So this is a known problem.

I agree that the Kernel has to respect RTAS's restriction. The PAPR
v2.8.1, Requirement R1-7.2.3-8 under section 7.2.3 says the following:

    "The stop-self service needs to be serialized with calls to the
     stop-self, start-cpu, and set-power-level services. The OS must
     be able to call RTAS services on other processors while the
     processor is stopped or being stopped"

Thus the onus is on the OS to ensure that there are no concurrent rtas
calls with "stop-self" token.

Ah, yes this is good optimization. Though, I think we ought to
unconditionally wait until the target CPU has woken up from CEDE and
changed its state to CPU_STATE_OFFLINE. After if PROD failed, then we
would have caught it in dlpar_offline_cpu() itself.

Sure. I will test the patch and report back.
