There are historic reasons.  PCI provides ISA IO space, and when you
have a machine with ISA peripherals present, the PCI IO space must
never be unmapped - if it is, ISA drivers will oops the kernel.  There
is no way for a vanishing PCI controller to cause ISA drivers to be
unbound.

If you have a host controller that does unmap PCI IO space and you have
ISA peripherals with drivers present, unbinding the PCI host controller
will remove the IO space mapping, and next time an ISA peripheral
touches IO space, the kernel will oops.

... which has been created in PCI land just to deal with PCI without
regard for the above issue.

However, there's another issue I missed - if you _do_ have ISA
peripherals, you likely want the IO space setup from very early on,
and you won't be using the new fangled PCI host driver support anyway.
That uses pci_map_io_early() rather than pci_ioremap_io() or
pci_remap_io().

Yes, that would be a good longer term plan - we don't need three
different ways to map PCI IO space, but it is development.

Well, arguably, the patch that caused the regression is the buggy patch,
_not_ the lack of unmapping API for pci_ioremap_io().  Trying to address
a regression with further development means that _that_ development
needs thought and review, which is a slower process.

I do understand the desire to keep moving forward and never take a step
backwards, but sometimes backwards steps are the best way to resolve a
regression.  But I also do appreciate that a simple revert in this case
is not possible.

I'll accept your patch on the condition that the ARM private
pci_ioremap_io() will go away in the very near future (please _try_
to get agreement on that before this patch is merged.)
