Yeah, and that is the wrong approach. Let's try to fix this properly
this time. As the above outlines, the worst case we can end up mid-term
would be to wrap vmalloc calls with the scope api with a TODO. But I am
pretty sure the respective maintainers can come up with a better
solution. I am definitely willing to help here.
