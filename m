Subject: [RFC PATCH 00/10] fs-verity: filesystem-level integrity protection
Date:   Fri, 24 Aug 2018 09:16:32 -0700

Hello,

This RFC patchset implements fs-verity for ext4 and f2fs.  fs-verity is
similar to dm-verity, but implemented on a per-file basis: a Merkle tree
hidden past the end of the file is used to verify the file's data as it
is paged in.  Most of the code is in fs/verity/, and not too many
filesystem-specific changes are needed.  The Merkle tree is written by
userspace before calling an ioctl to mark the file as a verity file; the
file then becomes read-only and the tree is hidden from userspace.

Note: on Monday, Michael Halcrow and I will be giving a talk about
fs-verity at the Linux Security Summit.  fs-verity was also previously
discussed at LSFMM 2018; see https://lwn.net/Articles/752614/.  It was
also previously discussed on linux-fsdevel here:
https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-fsdevel/msg121182.html

Since fs-verity provides the Merkle tree root hash in constant time and
verifies data blocks on-demand, it is useful for efficiently verifying
the authenticity of, or "appraising", large files of which only a small
portion may be accessed -- such as Android application (APK) files.  It
can also be useful in "audit" use cases where file hashes are logged.
fs-verity also provides better protection against malicious disk
firmware than an ahead-of-time hash, since fs-verity re-verifies data
each time it's paged in.

This patchset doesn't yet include IMA support for fs-verity file
measurements; this is planned and we'd like to collaborate with the IMA
maintainers.  Although fs-verity can be used on its own without IMA,
fs-verity is primarily a lower level feature (think of it as a way of
hashing a file), so some users will probably still need IMA's policy
mechanism.  The patchset *does* include an optional means of including a
signature in the fs-verity metadata and verifying it against the
certificates in an fs-verity keyring; though, this might need to be
re-assessed if it turns out IMA works just as well for that use case.

For now this patchset only supports the case where the fs-verity block
sizes are equal to PAGE_SIZE.  However, the fs-verity block sizes can be
different from the filesystem's block size.

A documentation file in Documentation/filesystems/ is planned but not
yet included.

This patchset is based on Linux v4.18.  It can also be found in git at
tag "fsverity_2018-08-24" of:

	https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ebiggers/linux.git

A userspace utility for fs-verity can be found at:

	https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ebiggers/fsverity-utils.git

See the README.md file in the userspace utility source tree for examples.

Tests for fs-verity can be found at branch "fsverity" of:

	https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ebiggers/xfstests-dev.git

On ext4 and f2fs, using fs-verity requires setting the verity feature
flag on your filesystem.  The verity feature flag is supported since
e2fsprogs 1.44.4-2 and f2fs-tools 1.11.0.

Warning: besides the feature bit and inode flag, fs-verity's on-disk
format is not yet stable, i.e. it can still be changed.  Please don't
use this patchset "in production" yet!

Feedback on the design and implementation is greatly appreciated.

Thanks!
