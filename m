Yup, I'll add that

I think I should have that covered already - "Intent does not block read, but
does block other intent locks"

You hold both write and intent, like so:

six_lock_intent(&foo->lock);
six_lock_write(&foo->lock);
six_unlock_write(&foo->lock);
six_unlock_intent(&foo->lock);

Readers can starve writers in the current implementation, but that's something
that should probably be fixed...

Separate queues per lock type, so dropping a write lock will wake up everyone
trying to take a read lock, and dropping an intent lock wakes up everyone trying
to take an intent lock.

Here's the new documentation I just wrote:

/*
 * Shared/intent/exclusive locks: sleepable read/write locks, much like rw
 * semaphores, except with a third intermediate state, intent. Basic operations
 * are:
 *
 * six_lock_read(&foo->lock);
 * six_unlock_read(&foo->lock);
 *
 * six_lock_intent(&foo->lock);
 * six_unlock_intent(&foo->lock);
 *
 * six_lock_write(&foo->lock);
 * six_unlock_write(&foo->lock);
 *
 * Intent locks block other intent locks, but do not block read locks, and you
 * must have an intent lock held before taking a write lock, like so:
 *
 * six_lock_intent(&foo->lock);
 * six_lock_write(&foo->lock);
 * six_unlock_write(&foo->lock);
 * six_unlock_intent(&foo->lock);
 *
 * Other operations:
 *
 *   six_trylock_read()
 *   six_trylock_intent()
 *   six_trylock_write()
 *
 *   six_lock_downgrade():	convert from intent to read
 *   six_lock_tryupgrade():	attempt to convert from read to intent
 *
 * Locks also embed a sequence number, which is incremented when the lock is
 * locked or unlocked for write. The current sequence number can be grabbed
 * while a lock is held from lock->state.seq; then, if you drop the lock you can
 * use six_relock_(read|intent_write)(lock, seq) to attempt to retake the lock
 * iff it hasn't been locked for write in the meantime.
 *
 * There are also operations that take the lock type as a parameter, where the
 * type is one of SIX_LOCK_read, SIX_LOCK_intent, or SIX_LOCK_write:
 *
 *   six_lock_type(lock, type)
 *   six_unlock_type(lock, type)
 *   six_relock(lock, type, seq)
 *   six_trylock_type(lock, type)
 *   six_trylock_convert(lock, from, to)
 *
 * A lock may be held multiple types by the same thread (for read or intent,
 * not write) - up to SIX_LOCK_MAX_RECURSE. However, the six locks code does
 * _not_ implement the actual recursive checks itself though - rather, if your
 * code (e.g. btree iterator code) knows that the current thread already has a
 * lock held, and for the correct type, six_lock_increment() may be used to
 * bump up the counter for that type - the only effect is that one more call to
 * unlock will be required before the lock is unlocked.
 *
