I am not questioning ASLR in general. I am asking whether we really need
per mmap ASLR in general. I can imagine that some environments want to
pay the additional price and other side effects, but considering this
can be achieved by libc, why to add more code to the kernel?

/dev/[u]random is not sufficient?

/proc/self/maps?

I do not understand. a) you should be prepared to pay an additional
price for an additional security measures and b) how would anybody punch
a hole into your mapping?

This is true in general, isn't it? I fail to see how kernel chosen and
user chosen ranges would make any difference.

Well, on the other hand the new layout mode will add a maintenance
burden on the kernel and will have to be maintained for ever because it
is a user visible ABI.

Well, I am pretty sure userspace can implement proper free ranges
tracking...
