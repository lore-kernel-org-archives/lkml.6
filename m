*Most* of the time it's not needed, but there are times when it is.
We could be more smart about sending down GFP_NOFS only when it is
needed.  If we are sending too many GFP_NOFS's allocations such that
it's causing heartburn, we could fix this.  (xattr commands are rare
enough that I dind't think it was worth it to modulate the GFP flags
for this particular case, but we could make it be smarter if it would
help.)

This is something we could do in ext4.  It hadn't been high priority,
because we've been rather overloaded.  As a suggestion, could you take
documentation about how to convert to the memalloc_nofs_{save,restore}
scope api (which I think you've written about e-mails at length
before), and put that into a file in Documentation/core-api?

The question I was trying to figure out which triggered the above
request is how/whether to gradually convert to that scope API.  Is it
safe to add the memalloc_nofs_{save,restore} to code and keep the
GFP_NOFS flags until we're sure we got it all right, for all of the
code paths, and then drop the GFP_NOFS?

Thanks,
