It is not actually a race. Both the hotplug event and any changes to cpu
lists or flags are serialized by the cpuset_mutex. It is just that we
may be doing the same work twice that we are wasting cpu cycles. So we
are doing a quick check to avoid this. The check isn't exhaustive and we
can certainly miss some cases. Doing a more throughout check may need as
much time as doing the sched domain generation itself and so you are
actually wasting more CPU cycles on average as the chance of a hotplug
event is very low.
