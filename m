Thanks. 
It's good to me. I just have a few remarks/suggestions:
 
With the warning disabled by default (for the moment), I had to adapt
the testsuite with:

Maybe it would be useful to add something along the line of "like directly using
the sizeof operator on void or doing pointer arithmetic on a void pointer" ?

I think that pointer arithmetic is much more useful than taking the size of void
(being able to take the size of *any* thing is somewhere in the middle, IMO).
But in all case, I don't think this part should belong to the man page.
