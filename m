Wasting 37% of memory is still better than the kernel randomly returning 
-ENOMEM when higher-order allocation fails.

For example, if you create a cache with 17KB objects, the slab subsystem 
will pad it up to 32KB. You are wasting almost 1/2 memory, but the 
allocation is realiable and it won't fail.

If you use order higher than 32KB, you get less wasted memory, but you 
also get random -ENOMEMs (yes, we had a problem in dm-thin that it was 
randomly failing during initialization due to 64KB allocation).
