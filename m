Hi! Find below my sixth regression report for Linux 4.16. It lists 7
regressions I'm currently aware of. 2 were fixed since last weeks
report; 2 are new.

Are you aware of any other regressions that got introduced this
development cycle? Then please let me know by mail (a simple bounce or
forward to the sender of this email address is enough!). And please tell
me if there is anything in the report that shouldn't be there.

Ciao, Thorsten
