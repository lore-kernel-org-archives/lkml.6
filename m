Hi,

Please indicate in the $subject that this is second version of the
patch as explained in:

  https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#the-canonical-patch-format

For example here the $subject should look like

  [PATCH v2] PCI: Consider alignment of hot-added bridges...

You can use

  git format-patch --subject-prefix="PATCH v2" ...

to generate such patch.

These should be put below '---' in the patch as described in

You should split that into a separate patch as it is different issue
AFAICT. Furthermore I think it may be good idea to spend more time
investigating and hopefully root causing the problem.
