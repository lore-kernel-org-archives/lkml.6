I realize the current implementation doesn't have a monotonic memory
requirement guarantee. I've added that, and below is updated memory
requirements per level. I've updated the commit to include this too.

I do see why we want to limit the number of levels as the memory
requirements do kind of bucket themselves. But, this means when zstd
gets updated, we'd have to reevaluate the compression levels btrfs
supports. I'm not sure it's a great idea to have that dependency.
I imagine we could offer some level of guidance, but it really would be
up to the user to figure out what works best for them.

The reclaim mechanism only keeps workspaces around if they are being
used by the appropriate level. So, the memory overhead is actively used
memory and if not, it is reclaimed after at most ~2 minutes later. I
also scan up before allocating a workspace, so that should help limit
the number of workspaces in circulation.
