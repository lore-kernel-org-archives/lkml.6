None of this works on the userspace/C side, nor should any attempt be
made to make it work. Types fundamentally cannot have alignments
larger than their size. If you want to make the alignment of some
pointers 8, you have to make their size 8, and then you just have LP64
again if you did it for all pointers.

If on the other hand you tried to make just some pointers "wide
pointers", you'd also be completely breaking the specified API
contracts of standard interfaces. For example in struct iovec's
iov_base, &foo->iov_base is no longer a valid pointer to an object of
type void* that you can pass to interfaces expecting void**. Sloppy
misunderstandings like what you're making now are exactly why x32 is
already broken and buggy (&foo->tv_nsec already has wrong type for
struct timespec foo).

If you wanted to do this and have it work, libc would have to
completely wrap and convert all the types from userspace structures
with the right types matching the specified API contracts to
kernel-interface structures that can be passed to the LP64 syscalls.
This could be done, but it's a big task, and I don't think anyone
wants to do it, especially if it would be yet another new thing that
doesn't exactly match the already-existing x32. The cost-benefit ratio
is just too high.

Unless it's a thin, "pure" library that doesn't need anything from
libc, or needs sufficiently little that it could be satisfied by some
shims, this would necessarily require having two libcs in the same
process, which is not going to work.
