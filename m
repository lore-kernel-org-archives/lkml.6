Thanks for the clarification! Since you are the maintainer and you
still consider the port useful, I don't see how anyone else would be
in a position to demand it to be removed, so we should keep it
around until you want it gone.

I still have a few questions:

- Any idea how we would find out of the status ever changes? E.g. if
  you decide at some point that you don't find the latest Linux useful
  any more for your internal work, would you send a patch for removal?

- How do I build an llvm based toolchain for Hexagon? Do I need patches
  on top of the llvm-6 release branch? Where can I find the corresponding
  binutils-2.30 sources?
