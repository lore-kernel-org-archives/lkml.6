That would be good yes.

Yes it needs to be a setup time check regardless actually !

The above is broken, sorry I was a bit quick here (too early in the
morning... ugh). We don't want the arch to go override the dma ops
every time that is callled.

But yes, if we can fix the overhead, it becomes just a matter of
setting up the "right" ops automatically.

OK well, assuming Christoph can solve the direct case in a way that
also work for the virtio !iommu case, we still want some bit of logic
somewhere that will "switch" to swiotlb based ops if the DMA mask is
limited.

You mentioned an RFC for that ? Do you happen to have a link ?

It would be indeed ideal if all we had to do was setup some kind of
bus_dma_mask on all PCI devices and have virtio automagically insert
swiotlb when necessary.

Cheers,
Ben.
