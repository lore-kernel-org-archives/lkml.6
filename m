Don't be silly ... there are many ways of coping with that in rpm/dpkg.
 However, I take it the fact you're now trying to get me to explain
them means you take the point that a kernel dynamic option can be
activated in a variety of easy ways in a distribution including through
the boot menu; so if you want this to appear in the boot menu you don't
need a Kconfig option to achieve it.

Well, if you build your own kernel and we have a dynamic option, it
will "just work" without you having to muck about trying to re-Kconfig
it, so I'd see that as a win.

So you're shifting your argument from "I have to do it as a Kconfig
option because the distros require it" to "distributions will build
separate kernel packages for this, but won't do enabling in a non
kernel package"?  To be honest, I think the argument is nuts but I
don't really care.  From my point of view it's usually me explaining to
people how to debug stuff and "you have to build your own kernel with
this Kconfig option" compared to "add this to the kernel command line
and reboot" is much more effort for the debugger.
