The audio codec goes from register 0x0800 - 0x0844, with the next
register being defined @ 0x0a00. So it definetly has its own register
range. I should note though, that 0x0800 is the audio regulator
control. In Linux we handle this one in the regulator driver instead
of in the audio driver. But this is mostly hidden in DT (the voltage
ranges for VAUDIO are described in the regulator node now).

We still have the node, so that it can be used with the ASoC graph
binding. It just has no compatible value. Instead it is identified
by the node's name.
