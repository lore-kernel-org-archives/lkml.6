People already maintain the kernel man pages and are very good.

You're incorrect on this point. See programs cobbled together out of
syscall(2) invocations today: despite lack of libc integration, things
do mostly work in practice. Calling through a library can't possible
be worse, and in many ways can be much better.

> thread cancellation internals,

As I mentioned upthread, the only thing a libc needs in order to
support cancellation properly (at least the way glibc does it)
is a way to ask the kernel-provided userspace library whether a
particular program counter address belongs to a certain code sequence
immediately before the system call instruction, whatever that is.
Providing this facility is doable without deep knowledge of libc's
internals, and libc can use it without a deep knowledge of the
interface library.

As someone else mentioned, errno is a libc construct. It's not *hard*
to support setting errno though: libc could just be required to supply
a well-defined libc_set_errno symbol that the kernel ABI library would
then use as needed.

This library would not have to do the things that libc does. Why would
it have to support libc's feature test macros at all?

The kernel should have a set of types and a symbol namespace
completely disjoint from libc's, with no compatibility hacks or macros
needed. (That might take some renaming kernel-side.) If libc wants to
provide a POSIX API, it can take on the responsibility for mapping the
kernel's structures to libc's, but within its namespace, the kernel
should be able to add types without fear of conflict.

Most proposed new system calls do not create threads, manipulate
signal masks, or muck with other internals, so these concerns just
don't apply. That's why syscall(2) mostly works in practice. Even if a
few new system calls *do* involve these internal details and require
closer libc coordination, the majority (e.g., the new mount API,
termios2) don't, and so can be exposed directly from the kernel
project without being blocked by glibc.

A kernel-side fix here would be the cleanest approach.

Conversely, there's a lot of doubt-sowing from the other side that
makes shipping a kernel-provided interface library seem harder than it
is. Most new system calls do not bear on the integration concerns that
you and others are raising, and whatever problems remain can be solved
with a narrow interface between libc and a new interface library, one
that would let both evolve independently.

After looking at the history of settid, signal multi-handler
registration, and other proposed improvements running into the brick
wall of glibc's API process, I think it's clear that requiring glibc
signoff on new kernel interfaces would simply lead to stagnation. It's
not as if we're approaching the problem from a position of ignorance.
The right answer is a move to an approximation of the BSD model and
bring the primary interface layer in-house.
 There's a lot of evidence that this model works.
