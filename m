I guess so. What you suggest? I was just folling the same guideline present

I also agree with that. The unroll iATU was introduced on Synopsys IP version
4.80 and the kernel patch was release on 2016-08-10
https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/657796/
However a separate register space for iATU implies some extra code do handle it
(and of course some tests) that don't fit into this patch series, in my point of
view. Can this task enter in the backlog in order to be done in another patch
series?
