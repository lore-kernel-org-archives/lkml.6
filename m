Again, I still claim this is broken hardware/firmware :)

I don't disagree with you at all, and your other email is great with
summarizing the issues here.

What I do object to is somehow relying on that function call as knowing
that the device really is present or not.  It's a good hint, yes, but
driver authors still have to be able to handle the bad data coming back
from when the call races with the device being removed.

And that's a great article and your work here is much appreciated.  I
think we are in violent agreement :)
