For my use case, verifying blobs (RPM headers or 'Release' for Debian-
based distributions) would be sufficient. The keys can be added at
compile time.

Users can verify signatures with the pgp_test key type (patch 10/12).
During the first attempt, pgp_test tries to use built-in keys. If
verification fails, pgp_test tries again with keys in the user keyring.
But if verification succeeds during the second attempt, the kernel
prints a warning saying that an untrusted key was used.

I kept PGP keys in the main keyring, so that verify_pgp_signature() uses
the same convention of verify_pkcs7_signature() (keyring == NULL: use
primary keys, keyring == 1: use secondary keys).

In your patches there was a capability checking mechanism, but it was
removed with commit db6c43bd2132.
