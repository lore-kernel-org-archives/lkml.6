OK, but there is not any direct connection between fsnotify_group and
task_struct lifetimes, is it? This makes the API suspectible to
use-after-free bugs.

So you charge page cache to the origin task but metadata to a different
memcg?

Maybe we need something more generic here.

Charging path is still a _hot path_. Especially when the kmem accounting
is enabled by default. You cannot simply downplay the overhead. We have
_one_ user but all users should pay the price. This is simply hard to
justify. Maybe we can thing of something that would put the burden on
the charging context?
