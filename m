Yes it's been there since the start.

Oh yeah, PM QoS might work here!

It sounds like Andy Shevchenko has a series of patches that just might
allow us to make this all generic for Linux serial framework. So adding
Andy to Cc, I don't think he has posted all the patches yet.

Andy, see the PM QoS comment above for console idling :)

Yup OK, I like the PM QoS approach.
