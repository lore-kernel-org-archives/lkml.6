Yes, but the lcd_rate and dsi_rate are not same, since dsi_rate is
again computed as dsi_div with pll_rate.

lcd_rate = dclk_rate * 6;
pll_rate = lcd_rate * 1;
dsi_rate = pll_rate / 6;

[   14.719981] tcon_div = 4, lcd_div = 1, dsi_div = 6, dsi_rate = 148500000
[   14.722666] dsi_div = 6, lcd_div = 1
[   14.722695] [DISP]disp_module_init finish
[   14.727699] lcd_rate = 180000000, pll_rate = 180000000
[   14.730269] dsi_rate = 30000000

Haa.. this is reason I have TCON_DCLK register value is 4 in BSP
# devmem 0x01c0c044
0xF0000004

330 or 180MHz. if we have pixel clock 30MHz with 6 div value it's 180MHz.

OK, thanks. will try digging further on this from my side as well.
