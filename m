The expected degradation would be little if the data is not very
performance sensitive.
I think vmalloc would be better in general case.

Even if the server has hundreds of gigabyte memory, even 1MB
contiguous memory is often rare.
For example, I attached /proc/pagetypeinfo of my server running for 153 days.
The largest contiguous memory is 2^7=512KB.

Node    0, zone   Normal, type    Unmovable   4499   9418   4817
732    747    567     18      3      0      0      0
Node    0, zone   Normal, type      Movable  38179  40839  10546
1888    491     51      1      0      0      0      0
Node    0, zone   Normal, type  Reclaimable    117     98   1279
35     21     10      8      0      0      0      0
Node    0, zone   Normal, type   HighAtomic      0      0      0
0      0      0      0      0      0      0      0
Node    0, zone   Normal, type      Isolate      0      0      0
0      0      0      0      0      0      0      0

So I think vmalloc would be good if it is not very performance critical data.
