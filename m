The Sunplus S+core architecture was added in 2009 by Chen Liqin,
who has been co-maintaining it with Lennox Wu <lennox.wu@gmail.com>
since then, but after they both left the company, nobody else has shown
any interest in the port and it has seen almost no activity other than
tree-wide changes.

The gcc port was removed a few years ago due to the inactivity.

While the sunplus website still advertises products with unspecified
RISC cores that might be S+core based, it's very clear that the Linux
port is completely abandoned at this point.

This removes all files related to the architecture.
