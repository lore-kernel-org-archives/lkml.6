Subject: [PATCH 00/14] arm64 SSBD (aka Spectre-v4) mitigation

Hi all,

This patch series implements the Linux kernel side of the "Spectre-v4"
(CVE-2018-3639) mitigation known as "Speculative Store Bypass Disable"
(SSBD).

More information can be found at:

  https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1528
  https://developer.arm.com/support/arm-security-updates/speculative-processor-vulnerability

For all released Arm Cortex-A CPUs that are affected by this issue, then
the preferred mitigation is simply to set a chicken bit in the firmware
during CPU initialisation and therefore no change to Linux is required.
Other CPUs may require the chicken bit to be toggled dynamically (for
example, when switching between user-mode and kernel-mode) and this is
achieved by calling into EL3 via an SMC which has been published as part
of the latest SMCCC specification:

  https://developer.arm.com/cache-speculation-vulnerability-firmware-specification

as well as an ATF update for the released ARM cores affected by SSDB:

  https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware/pull/1392

These patches provide the following:

  1. Safe probing of firmware to establish which CPUs in the system
     require calling into EL3 as part of the mitigation.

  2. For CPUs that require it, call into EL3 on exception entry/exit
     from EL0 to apply the SSBD mitigation when running at EL1.

  3. A command-line option to force the SSBD mitigation to be always on,
     always off, or dymamically toggled (default) for CPUs that require
     the EL3 call.

  4. An initial implementation of a prctl() backend for arm64 that allows
     userspace tasks to opt-in to the mitigation explicitly. This is
     intended to match the interface provided by x86, and so we rely on
     their core changes here. There still is an annoying issue with
     multithreaded seccomp tasks that get flagged with the mitigation
     whilst they are running in userspace.

  5. An initial implementation of the call via KVM, which exposes the
     mitigation to the guest via an HVC interface. This isn't yet
     complete and doesn't include save/restore functionality for the
     workaround state.

All comments welcome,

	M.
