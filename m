OK. At least we're aligned on this. As for your question about finding
out about the register, here's what I have in kvmtool:

+       reg.addr = (u64)&data;
+       reg.id = KVM_REG_ARM_PSCI_VERSION;
+       err = ioctl(vcpu->vcpu_fd, KVM_GET_ONE_REG, &reg);
+       if (err < 0)
+               pr_info("Unable to get PSCI version\n");
+       else
+               pr_info("PSCI version %llx\n", data);

If you get an error, the feature doesn't exist. One of the reasons for
using a register is that migration works with today's QEMU. And if you
try to restore a VM that's aware of the PSCI version (and possibly of
the BTB invalidation) on a host that doesn't support it, you get a fail
without any change of userspace.

To me, that's a pretty good argument in favour of this method. But if
you have strong feelings about it and would like me to implement
something else, please let me know ASAP. We'd like this series to land
in -rc1, so we only have a few days left...

We can. I tend to see the uapi/asm/kvm.h file as the reference (and I
feel that a text file would simply be an English translation of that
file), but I'm not opposed to it either. I'm not sure I have the
bandwidth for that at the moment though.

Thanks,
