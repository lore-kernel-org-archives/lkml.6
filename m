Would those fit in the 30 remaining padding bytes?

The problem with sigval_t of course is that it is incompatible between
32-bit and 64-bit. We can add the same information, but at least on
the syscall level that would have to be a __u64.

At least you and Al have managed to get it down to a single source-level
definition across all architectures, but there is also the (lesser) problem
that the structure has a slightly different binary layout on each of the
classic architectures.

If we go with Andy's suggestion of having only a single binary layout
on x86 for the new call, I'd argue that we should also make it have
the exact same layout on all other architectures.

I'm not sure I understand what you are suggesting here. Would the
low-level implementation of this be based on procfd, or do you
mean that would be done for pid_t at the kernel level, plus another
syscall for procfd?

This would be regardless of which flavor of siginfo (today's arch
specific one, signalfd_siginfo, or a new one) we pass, right?

And that would work for signalfd and waitid_time64, but not for
procfd_signal/kill/sendsiginfo?

I think it means we still need more discussion. Using signalfd_siginfo
without further changes doesn't seem sufficient because of the missing
sigval and the excessive length adds some cost.

siginfo_t as it is now still has a number of other downsides, and Andy in
particular didn't like the idea of having three new variants on x86
(depending on how you count). His alternative suggestion of having
a single syscall entry point that takes a 'signfo_t __user *' but interprets
it as compat_siginfo depending on in_compat_syscall()/in_x32_syscall()
should work correctly, but feels wrong to me, or at least inconsistent
with how we do this elsewhere.
