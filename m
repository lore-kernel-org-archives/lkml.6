Yes, that seems overly conservative.

Well, that's pretty gross. Is this not exactly the situation mmiowb() is 
meant to solve? See [1].

Though, you're right in principle. Even if power was similar to other 
systems in this way, it's still a risk that if these pages get passed 
somewhere in the kernel that uses a spin lock like that without an 
mmiowb() call, then it's going to have a bug. For now, the risk is 
pretty low as we know exactly where all the p2pmem pages will be used 
but if it gets into other places, all bets are off. I did do some work 
trying to make a safe version of io-pages and also trying to change from 
pages to pfn_t in large areas but neither approach seemed likely to get 
any traction in the community, at least not in the near term.
