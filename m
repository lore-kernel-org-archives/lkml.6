This is the point of the hash step.  The value encrypted with the block cipher
to produce the intermediate value C_M (used as the stream cipher nonce) is
H(T, P_L) + P_R.  (T is the tweak a.k.a the IV, P_L is the plaintext except the
last 16 bytes, P_R is the last 16 bytes.)  A collision in this value occurs iff:

	H(T1, P1_L) + P1_R = H(T2, P2_L) + P2_R
i.e.
	H(T1, P1_L) - H(T2, P2_L) = P2_R - P1_R
	
If (T1, P1_L) = (T2, P2_L) then P1_R != P2_R so the equation has no solutions
(since we don't consider queries where the whole input is the same; those
unavoidably produce the same ciphertext).  Otherwise (T1, P1_L) != (T2, P2_L),
and since the hash function H is ε-almost-∆-universal over integers mod 2^128,
the equation is true for at most a very small proportion 'ε' of hash keys.
But, the hash key is chosen at random and is unknown to the attacker.

The same applies in the other direction, for chosen ciphertext attacks.

Basically, it's very difficult for an attacker to cause the intermediate value
C_M to be reused, and the outputs will appear random until they do.

Of course, all this is explained much more precisely and comprehensively in our
paper.  See section 5, "Security reduction".
