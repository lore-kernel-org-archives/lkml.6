Can someone please answer why this is even needed to begin with? I
don't see any compelling reason __stack_chk_guard needs a particular
value in the decompressor, which is not dealing with any non-constant
input. Just putting __stack_chk_guard in its bss should be fine and
would eliminate all the risks of wrong code to load a value into it.
Alternatively put it in initialized data with the desired value.
