Yeah, I think it's ugly no matter what.  Personally I find the
if/then/else easier to follow than the complicated conditions split
across multiple lines.  I seem to remember there was something that my
version did differently than yours too (hence the "this might be more
important if you get rid of the initial setting"), let's see if I can
figure it out again.

Mine says:
- if it has exactly 1.8 or 3.3 support: set that.
- else if it supports both: set whatever is requested
- else (it support neither): do nothing

Yours says:
- if it supports high and requests high: set it high
- if it supports low and requests low: set it low

...so your code assumes that it was already set to the right thing if
it only supports 1.8 or only support 3.3.  Hence my comment about this
being important if you get rid of the initial settings as I was
suggesting.

My understanding is locking primitives (spin locks and mutexes) always
act as a barrier.  This is why most of the time you shouldn't need to
think about barriers.  As long as you've got things protected by
spinlocks and/or mutexes then the ordering will work out right.

Specifically, see
<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/memory-barriers.txt>

> Some of the other functions in the linux kernel imply memory barriers, amongst
> which are locking and scheduling functions.

Said another way, if you have two routines:

routine_a() {
  lock(driver_global_lock);
  writel_relaxed(region_a);
  unlock(driver_global_lock);
}

routine_b() {
  lock(driver_global_lock);
  writel_relaxed(region_b);
  unlock(driver_global_lock);
}

If you call:
  routine_a();
  routine_b();

You can be assured that the write to region_a will take place before
the write to region_b.  As I understand it, no extra barriers are
required.  This is why most people don't need to worry about
barriers--they just use locks.  The only argument you have for
barriers at all in this file is that you have two different memory
regions that you've iomapped.

...basically if something you do causes both a lock() and unlock() you
can be sure that your memory has been written by the time the unlock()
finishes.

I guess I will leave it to the wisdom of others if wake_up is
guaranteed to always acquire and release a lock.  Today it does and
that means that any memory writes that happen before the call to
wake_up() will finish by the time wake_up() finishes.

Of course, my overall advice remains to get rid of the "relaxed" usage
everywhere except in places were you truly believe it's performance
critical.

Did you try my suggestion of: "Can't you just move the call to
sdhci_msm_set_regulator_caps() before the call to
sdhci_msm_handle_pwr_irq() in probe?  Then just let that first call to
sdhci_msm_handle_pwr_irq() do this work?" or did I miss something
there?  Specifically that will make the caps_0 get set early.  ...now
when sdhci_msm_probe() manually calls sdhci_msm_handle_pwr_irq()
caps_0 will be set and it can do all this work there.  That should
avoid this duplicated code.
