I'd advise caution with a user supplied BDF approach, we have no
guaranteed persistence for a device's PCI address.  Adding a device
might renumber the buses, replacing a device with one that consumes
more/less bus numbers can renumber the buses, motherboard firmware
updates could renumber the buses, pci=assign-buses can renumber the
buses, etc.  This is why the VT-d spec makes use of device paths when
describing PCI hierarchies, firmware can't know what bus number will be
assigned to a device, but it does know the base bus number and the path
of devfns needed to get to it.  I don't know how we come up with an
option that's easy enough for a user to understand, but reasonably
robust against hardware changes.  Thanks,

Alex
