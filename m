I agree that we shouldn't do this for sparse warnings, but the one I'm
interested in is a compiler warning in the allmodconfig build, as
found by kernelci.org. This is one of only three remaining warnings
that it reports for any of the default builds, see [1] for the overall
build reports on mainline kernels, and [2] for the detailed log of
the arm64 allmodconfig build that shows it.

A small complication is that I wrote the changelog for the build warning
on 32-bit architectures, which is more elaborate. kernelci.org for
some reasons currently skips the allmodconfig build on all 32-bit
architectures (I should ask the kernelci maintainers to change that),
but the same patch I sent also addresses a warning on bit-endian
64-bit architectures:

../drivers/infiniband/hw/bnxt_re/qplib_fp.c: In function
'bnxt_qplib_create_srq':
../include/uapi/linux/byteorder/big_endian.h:31:52: warning: passing
argument 1 of '__fswab64' makes integer from pointer without a cast
[-Wint-conversion]
 #define __cpu_to_le64(x) ((__force __le64)__swab64((x)))
                                                    ^
../include/uapi/linux/swab.h:132:12: note: in definition of macro '__swab64'
  __fswab64(x))
            ^
../include/linux/byteorder/generic.h:86:21: note: in expansion of
macro '__cpu_to_le64'
 #define cpu_to_le64 __cpu_to_le64
                     ^
../drivers/infiniband/hw/bnxt_re/qplib_fp.c:569:19: note: in expansion
of macro 'cpu_to_le64'
  req.srq_handle = cpu_to_le64(srq);
                   ^
../include/uapi/linux/swab.h:65:41: note: expected '__u64 {aka long
long unsigned int}' but argument is of type 'struct bnxt_qplib_srq *'
 static inline __attribute_const__ __u64 __fswab64(__u64 val)

On x86 and on the arm64 defconfig build, the __cpu_to_le64() is defined in
include/uapi/linux/byteorder/little_endian.h and degrades into a __force
cast that happens to avoid this warning, but on arm64 allmodconfig,
we use include/uapi/linux/byteorder/big_endian.h, which passes
the pointer into __swab64() first, and that warns about the type
mismatch.
