Ah, sorry, I guess my message was misleading. I'm saying this is
changing the way _EAS_ deals with RT tasks. Right now we don't actually
consider the RT-go-to-max thing at all in the EAS prediction. Your
patch is changing that AFAICT. It actually changes the way EAS sees RT
tasks even without uclamp ...

But I'm not hostile to the idea since it's possible to enable uclamp and
set the min cap to 0 for RT if you want. So there is a story there.
However, I think this needs be documented somewhere, at the very least.

Thanks,
Quentin
