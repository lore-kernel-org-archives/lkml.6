Userspace can save/restore any state it deems necessary. Is there another
reason to invent a pseudo register? Considering the PSCI version is VM
state, then maybe a VM "device" attribute[*], like s390 use, would fit
better. Or, if keeping it VCPU state has some benefit, then we already
have VCPU device attribute support for ARM that we could extend with
another attribute. An advantage of using the device-attr API is that it
has KVM_HAS_DEVICE_ATTR, allowing the new attribute support to be probed.
How should userspace check if the pseudo register is supported? Maybe
by just failing with NOT_SUPPORTED to get/set it?

Is this 0x14 documented somewhere? I'm just curious how the space for
pseudo registers is reserved. Is there a common place that we should
document that 0x14 is for the firmware (if it's not documented there
already)?

Thanks,
