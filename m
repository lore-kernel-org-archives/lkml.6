No, in the hardware this is the result of the instruction in the SCSW.
Not the instruction itself.

There are also differences and it breaks the FSM

I do not agree, this is true for the SCSW but not for instructions.
We receive instructions in VFIO and give back status.
The name used to provide the command is misleading.

What you say is right if we would have a register inside the subchannel
where we write the commands.
But this is not what we handle we handle separate instructions coming
from an instruction stream.

We do never receive two instructions at the same time, but each after
the other.
If the sub-channel is busy on IO a clear or a cancel must be able to 
stop the IO.
I agree upon this.
But we do not have any other command in the same call.

If we would construct the interface differently, for example using an 
mmap() system
call and let the user ORing the command bitfield before using an ioctl 
to inform
us from the change, or if we poll on the command bitfield we should 
implement
it like you say.
But this is not what we do, and this is not what the architecture does.
does it?

This is already what is done here:
We fire off the start (go to BUSY state) and return

If the guest want to start another command it polls on
the vfio_write() untill the channel isn't BUSY anymore.

On interrupt we set the channel back to IDLE and the next
command shall be proceed.

(I must enhance the cover letter (already said))

Yes I think it is feasible and it is what we need to do.

CLEAR, CANCEL and HALT must be able to overtake the
START and really stop the IO transfer.

They just should be able to proceed in the BUSY state
on the opposite of the START.
This is easily done with new events in the FSM inside
both IDLE and BUSY states

May be I should try to integrate your patches so we have a better view.

Thanks.

Best regards,

Pierre
