Let me rephrase this, and tell me if I understood it correctly:

- A level interrupt is injected, activated by the guest (LR state=active)
- guest exits, re-enters, (LR state=pending+active)
- guest EOIs the interrupt (LR state=pending)
- maintenance interrupt
- we don't signal the resampling because we're not in an invalid state

Is that correct?

That's an interesting case, because it seems to invalidate some of the 
optimization that went in over a year ago.

096f31c4360f KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Get rid of MISR and EISR fields
b6095b084d87 KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Get rid of unnecessary save_maint_int_state
af0614991ab6 KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Get rid of unnecessary process_maintenance operation

We could compare the value of the LR before the guest entry with
the value at exit time, but we still could miss it if we have a
transition such as P+A -> P -> A and assume a long enough propagation
delay for the maintenance interrupt (which is very likely).

In essence, we have lost the benefit of EISR, which was to give us a
way to deal with asynchronous signalling.

That feels very wrong. You're now signalling the resampling in both
invalid and pending+active, and the latter state doesn't mean you've
EOIed anything. You're now over-signalling, and signalling the
wrong event.

Assuming I understand the issue correctly, I cannot really see how
to solve this without reintroducing EISR, which sucks majorly.

I'll try to cook something shortly and we can all have a good
fight about how crap this is.

Thanks,
