Honestly, I almost never worry about alignment... the very few times I do care,
I use __cacheline_aligned_in_smp.

If alignment is a concern in any of those structs, there really ought to be a
comment indicating it. I very much doubt anything I touched was performance
sensitive enough for it to be an issue, though. And if there is a performance
impact, it should be oughtweighed by the reduced pointer chasing.

If you disagree, I don't mind leaving the device mapper patch out, it really
makes no difference to me. I could glance over for alignment issues but I feel
like my analysis would not be terribly valuable to you considering I've already
said my position on alignment is "meh, don't care" :)
