Thank you. I didn't get this information from Renesas :-)

Thank you, this is very valuable. I will do as you suggested.

Well, this is actually something different. If you look you will
notice that my patch was part of a 3 part patch series,
the first of which disabled this test.

If you take all the 3 patches, it will work.

To make things more interesting, I have since sending the patch
learned WHY the test does not work, so disabling
it is not needed - to make a long story short, I was reading the wrong
register that just happens to have the right value
in our FPGA based tests systems but does not in the real silicon
implementations.

But you are right - if the clock is not enabled and you are try to
read from the register the system does freeze.

I will send a fixed v2. based on your patch enabling the CR clock.

This is very interesting and I will give it a try.

Thanks again!
