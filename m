There's the option of reserving PROT_NONE regions and managing memory
within them using a similar best-fit allocation scheme to get separate
random bases. The kernel could offer something like that but it's
already possible to do it for libc mmap usage within libc as we did
for libraries.

The kernel's help is needed to cover non-libc users of mmap, i.e. not
the linker, malloc, etc. It's not possible for libc to assume that
everything goes through the libc mmap/mremap/munmap wrappers and it
would be a mess so I'm not saying the kernel doesn't have a part to
play. I'm only saying it makes sense to look at the whole picture and
if something can be done better in libc or the linker, to do it there
instead. There isn't an API for dividing stuff up into regions, so it
has to be done in userspace right now and I think it works a lot
better when it's an option.

I don't think it's out-of-scope. There are different approaches to
this kind of finer-grained randomization and they can be done
together.

The issue is that the kernel is only providing a mapping so it can add
a random gap or randomize it in other ways but it's ultimately up to
libc and other userspace code to do randomization without those
mappings.

A malloc implementation is similarly going to request fairly large
mappings from the kernel to manage a bunch of stuff within them
itself. The kernel can't protect against stuff like heap spray attacks
very well all by itself. It definitely has a part to play in that but
is a small piece of it (unless the malloc impl actually manages
virtual memory regions itself, which is already done by
performance-oriented allocators for very different reasons).

Fragmenting the virtual address space means having more TLB cache
misses, etc. Spreading out the mappings more also increases memory
usage and overhead for anything tied to the number of VMAs, which is
hopefully all O(log n) where it matters but O(log n) doesn't mean
increasing `n` is free.

I think they found a good compromise between low fragmentation vs.
some security benefits.

The main thing I'd like to see is just the option to get a guarantee
of enforced gaps around mappings, without necessarily even having
randomization of the gap size. It's possible to add guard pages in
userspace but it adds overhead by doubling the number of system calls
to map memory (mmap PROT_NONE region, mprotect the inner portion to
PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE) and *everything* using mmap would need to
cooperate which is unrealistic.

Yeah, the correctness issue should definitely be fixed. The default
value would *really* need to be raised if greatly increasing the
number of VMAs by not using a performance / low-fragmentation focused
best-fit algorithm without randomization or enforced gaps.
