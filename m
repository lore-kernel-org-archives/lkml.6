The build testing is good, but I worry that some of the affected files
don't clearly have numa.h in their include paths, for the NUMA_NO_NODE
definition.

The first thing I looked it is arch/powerpc/include/asm/pci-bridge.h. 
Maybe it somehow manages to include numa.h via some nested include, but
if so, is that reliable across all config combinations and as code
evolves?

So I think that the patch should have added an explicit include of
numa.h, especially in cases where the affected file previously had no
references to any of the things which numa.h defines.
