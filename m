You never even begun explaining what you were defending against. Let

That sounds like security through obscurity. Sure it makes it harder,
but it doesn't stop anything.

Since you need to modify page-tables in order to achieve this, the
page-tables are also there for the attacker to write to.

I really am still strugging with what it is this thing is supposed to
do. As it stands, I see very little value. Yes it makes a few things a
little harder, but it doesn't really do away with things.

I do not in fact agree. Most pages are not interesting for an attack at
all. So simply reducing the set of pages you can write to isn't
sufficient.

IOW. removing all noninteresting pages from the writable set will
satisfy your criteria, but it avoids exactly 0 exploits.

What you need to argue is that we remove common exploit targets, and
you've utterly failed to do so.

Kees mentioned: function pointers, page-tables and a few other things.
You mentioned nothing.

That's just a bunch of words together that don't really say anything
afaict.

If you make RO all noninteresting pages, you in fact increase the
density of interesting targets and make things easier.

What?! Are you saying you don't care about performance?

It is not. Every architecture does switch_mm() with IRQs disabled, as
that is exactly what the scheduler does.

And keeping a second init_mm around also isn't very architecture
specific I feel.

Those constraints are due to single page aliases.

See below, I don't think kmap_atomic() is either correct or workable.

One thing that might be interesting is teaching objtool about the
write-enable write-disable markers and making it guarantee we reach a
disable after every enable. IOW, ensure we never leak this state.

I think that was part of why we hated on that initial thing Kees did --
well that an disabling all WP is of course completely insane ;-).

Don't think so. kmap_atomic() on x86_32 (64bit doesn't have it at all)
only does the TLB invalidate on the one CPU, which we've established is
incorrect.

Also, kmap_atomic is still page-table based, which means not all
page-tables can be read-only.

You've still not talked about any actual attack vectors and how they're
mitigated by these patches.

I suppose the 'normal' attack goes like:

 1) find buffer-overrun / bound check failure
 2) use that to write to 'interesting' location
 3) that write results arbitrary code execution
 4) win

Of course, if the store of 2 is to the current cred structure, and
simply sets the effective uid to 0, we can skip 3.

Which seems to suggest all cred structures should be made r/o like this.
But I'm not sure I remember these patches doing that.


Also, there is an inverse situation with all this. If you make
everything R/O, then you need this allow-write for everything you do,
which then is about to include a case with an overflow / bound check
fail, and we're back to square 1.

What are you doing to avoid that?
