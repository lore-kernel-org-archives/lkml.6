It sounds like you have very tight hardware expectations for this to work
at this moment. You also don't want to generalize this code for others and
address the shortcomings.

To get you going, you should limit this change to the switch products that you have
validated via white-listing PCI vendor/device ids. Please do not enable this feature
for all other PCI devices or by default.

I think your code qualifies as a virus until this issue is resolved (so NAK). 

Another option is for your CONFIG to depend on BROKEN/EXPERT.

You are delivering a general purpose P2P code with a lot of holes in it and
expecting people to jump through it.

Turning security off by default is also not acceptable. Linux requires ACS support
even though you don't care about it for your particular application.

I'd hate ACS to be broken due to some operating system enabling your CONFIG option.
