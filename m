The code looks at devfn because it's meant to work for PCI including
when the devices dont have a device node in the DT.

What I'm trying to figure out is what is it that your parent and
children are representing here. Which is/are the root complex ?

What is the actual topology as visible on the PCIe bus (is lspci output
basically) and how does that map to your representation ?
