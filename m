No.  And even if it were, the /system partition is going to request
that the kernel encrypt files using one and only encryption algorithm:
namely, AES.

Things aren't as configurable on an Android phone as you might be used
to on a laptop.  Some manufacturers use ext4; some manufacturers
decide they want to use f2fs.  They make that decision not you, and
only the file system utilities for that one file system are compiled
into the system.

Similarly, you don't get to choose what crypto algorithm you use;
that's decided for you by the manufacturer.  Which is good; it's one
less thing that hte attacker can spoof, and one less thing for users
to potentially get wrong.
