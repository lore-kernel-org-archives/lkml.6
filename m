Fair point.

great.

Yes.

I don't think you could consider a report from "aggressive reporting" to
 be a false positive. It's clearly possible that this happens, and once
you go to a workqueue you basically don't really know your sequencing
and timing any more.

Ok, I thought you were arguing we shouldn't revert it :)

I don't know whether to revert or just add the pairs in the flush
functions, because I can't say I understand what the third part of the
patch does.

Yes, it should be called regardless of whether we actually wait or not,
i.e. before most of the checking in the functions.

My issue #3 that I outlined is related - we'd like to have lockdep
understand that if this work was on the WQ it might deadlock, but we
don't have a way to get the WQ unless the work is scheduled - and in the
case that it is scheduled we might already hitting the deadlock
(depending on the order of execution though I guess).

Ok, you know what, I'm going to read this now ... hang on........

I see. You were trying to solve the problem of completions/context
transfers in lockdep.

Given the revert of crossrelease though, we can't actually revert your
patch anyway, and looking at it again I see what you mean by the "name"
now ...

So yeah, we should only re-add the two acquire/release pairs. I guess
I'll make a patch for that, replacing my patch 2.

I'm intrigued by the crossrelease - but that's a separate topic.
