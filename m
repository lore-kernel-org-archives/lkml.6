Yes.  From there kernel's perspective a #PF occurred on the %RIP of the
AEX target.  This holds true for all AEX types, e.g. GUEST_RIP on VMExit
also points at the AEX target.  On an AEX, %RAX, %RBX and %RCX are set
to match the ERESUME parameter.  The idea is for userspace to have an
ENCU at the AEX so that it automatically ERESUMEs the enclave after the
kernel handles the fault.  And the trampoline approach means the ucode
flows for exceptions, interrupts, VMExit, VMEnter, IRET, RSM, etc...
generally don't need to be SGX-aware.  The events themselves just need
to be redirected to the AEX target and then redo the event.

Completely depends on the enclave and its runtime.  A simple enclave
mayy never expect to encounter a bad access or #UD and so its runtime
would probably just kill it.  A test/development enclave might have
its runtime call back into the enclave to dump state on a fatal fault.

Complex runtimes, e.g. libraries that wrap unmodified applications,
will call back into the enclave so that libraries in-enclave fault
handler can decode what went wrong and take action accordingly, e.g.
request CPUID information if unmodified code tried to do CPUID.

No argument there.  That's why I like the approach of dumping the
exception to userspace without trying to do anything intelligent in
the kernel.  Userspace can then do whatever it wants AND we don't
have to worry about mucking with stacks.

One of the hiccups with the VDSO approach is that the enclave may
want to use the untrusted stack, i.e. the stack that has the VDSO's
stack frame.  For example, Intel's SDK uses the untrusted stack to
pass parameters for EEXIT, which means an AEX might occur with what
is effectively a bad stack from the VDSO's perspective.
