That seems likely. I later noticed that I had oops=panic kernel parameter.

Yes, you are right, my mistake.

The comment about CONFIG_VMAP_STACK in arch/x86/kernel/traps.c says:
"If we overflow the stack into a guard page, the CPU will fail to deliver #PF
and will send #DF instead."

Thanks. I agree with all your points.

I wrote a third lkdtm test for STACKLEAK which runs deep recursion with alloca.
If I have just BUG_ON(size >= stack_left) in check_alloca(), I get the following
nice report without any trouble:

It seems that previously I was very "lucky" to accidentally have those MIN_STACK_LEFT,
call trace depth and oops=panic together to experience a hang on stack overflow
during BUG().


When I run my test in a loop _without_ VMAP_STACK, I manage to corrupt the neighbour
processes with BUG() handling overstepping the stack boundary. It's a pity, but
I have an idea.

In kernel/sched/core.c we already have:

#ifdef CONFIG_SCHED_STACK_END_CHECK
  	if (task_stack_end_corrupted(prev))
		panic("corrupted stack end detected inside scheduler\n");
#endif

So what would you think if I do the following in check_alloca():

	if (size >= stack_left) {
#if !defined(CONFIG_VMAP_STACK) && defined(CONFIG_SCHED_STACK_END_CHECK)
		panic("alloca over the kernel stack boundary\n");
#else
		BUG();
#endif

I think that fits well to the CONFIG_SCHED_STACK_END_CHECK policy.

Best regards,
Alexander
