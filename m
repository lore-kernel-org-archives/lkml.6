I'll try to be quick about it, but I expect it will take a few days to
hit everything and explain it here.

Makes sense.  Thanks for the explanation.

It looks like this:
               base_fpga_region {
                        #address-cells = <0x1>;
                        #size-cells = <0x1>;
                        compatible = "fpga-region";
                        fpga-mgr = <&fpga_mgr>;
                };

It is used as a target for applying DT overlays for FPGA reprogramming.

I'll give it a try and report back!

I expect that would not be hard.  The of-fpga-region.c driver would
only need small changes to know where to expect the properties it is
looking for.

And when the child nodes in the overlay are added to the live tree,
they would be under the added fake level. That shouldn't be a problem
either, it would just be different.

Yeah I don't love it either, but for the sake of discussion, it's
worth the mention.  I'm open for suggestions here definitely.  But yes
adding the fake level might make the DT code implementation more
straightforward at the cost of something that isn't great in the DT
itself.  We can keep scratching our heads a bit.

That is helpful.  Applying overlays may be a bit noisier for a while
until this gets ironed out.

Yes, the errors I hit were where the overlay tried to change
#address-cells.  I am thinking that we probably don't need to do that.
What we were doing was mapping multiple bridges (between the CPU and
FPGA) into different address spaces.  We probably don't have to do it
that way.  I'll try to bring in an example without making it
unnecessarily involved:

dts-v1/;
/plugin/;
/ {
        fragment@0 {
                target-path = "/soc/base_fpga_region";
                #address-cells = <1>;
                #size-cells = <1>;

                __overlay__ {
                        ranges = <0x00000000 0x00000000 0xc0000000
0x00040000>, //h2f bridge
                                 <0x00000001 0x00000000 0xff200000
0x00001000>; //lwh2f bridge
so on...

The h2f = hps (cpu) to fpga bridge = for DMA
The lwh2f = lightweight cpu to fpga = strongly ordered bridge for
register access

This will raise ERROR messages, but if I change it to the following,
it seems happier.
                        ranges = <0xc0000000 0xc0000000 0x00040000>,
                                 <0x00000000 0xff200000 0x00001000>;

Maybe we should be using dma-ranges for part of this anyway.
