So there's 3 things:

  smp_load_acquire(), smp_store_release()

  atomic*_{acquire,release}()

  *_{lock,unlock}();

Which are all quite distinct.

smp_load_acquire() and smp_store_release() are RCpc, and there is no
discussion of ever wanting to change that.

The atomics also follow this and are RCpc, in fact the RELEASE only
applies to the STORE and the ACQUIRE only applies to the LOAD of the
atomics.

The locking primitives OTOH we would really rather like to be RCsc, and
everybody except PPC has them as such, PPC being the only one having
RCpc locks.

I read the part you quoted from Daniel as being purely about spinlocks,
the 'critical section' wording being a dead give away, so I'm then
somewhat confused why you talk about atomics.
