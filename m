Let me pull out one tiny piece of this problem: If the VPD read
returns failure, the caller should not look at the read buffer.  But
we should *never* copy random stack garbage into the read buffer, no
matter what the VPD read returns.

I guess it's the 4.9.70 kernel that's putting garbage into the VPD
read buffer?  Is this something that needs to be fixed in the current
upstream kernel?
