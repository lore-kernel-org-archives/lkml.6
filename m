This has nothing to do with runtime PM AFAICS.

The device seems to be in D3hot on boot, is that correct?
The PCI core assumes that unbound devices remain in D0
(see comments in pci_pm_runtime_resume() / pci_pm_runtime_suspend()).

When scanning the bus and discovering the device is not in D0,
call pci_power_up().  This could probably go into pci_init_pm().
Once a driver binds to it, it may choose to runtime suspend it to
D3hot again.

Just an idea anyway.
