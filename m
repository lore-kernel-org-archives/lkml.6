I agree this particular case is technically safe, but figuring that
out requires an unreasonable amount of analysis.  And there's no hint
in the code that we need to be concerned about whether the readl()
returns valid data, so the need for the analysis won't even occur to
most readers.

I don't feel good about encouraging this style of adding an explicit
test for whether the device is available, followed by a completely
implicit test that accidentally happens to correctly handle a device
that was removed after the explicit test.

If we instead added a test for ~0 after the readl(), we would avoid
the race and give the reader a clue that *any* read from the device
can potentially fail without advance warning.

I think everything you said above is true, but I'm not yet convinced
that it's being applied usefully in mpt3sas.

  bool pci_dev_is_disconnected(pdev)       # "true" is definitive
  {
    return test_bit(PCI_DEV_DISCONNECTED, &dev->priv_flags);
  }

  bool pci_device_is_present(pdev)         # "false" is definitive
  {
    if (pci_dev_is_disconnected(pdev))
      return false;
    return pci_bus_read_dev_vendor_id(...);
  }

  mpt3sas_base_pci_device_is_available(ioc)  # "false" is definitive
  {
    return !ioc->pci_error_recovery && pci_device_is_present(ioc->pdev);
  }

  mpt3sas_wait_for_commands_to_complete(...)
  {
    ...
 +  if (!mpt3sas_base_pci_device_is_available(ioc))
 +    return;

    # In the definitive case, we returned above.  If we get here, we
    # think the device *might* be present.  The readl() inside
    # mpt3sas_base_get_iocstate() might fail (returning ~0 data).
    # It happens that (~0 & MPI2_IOC_STATE_MASK) != MPI2_IOC_STATE_OPERATIONAL
    # so we will return below if the device was removed after the
    # check above.

    ioc_state = mpt3sas_base_get_iocstate(ioc, 0);
    if ((ioc_state & MPI2_IOC_STATE_MASK) != MPI2_IOC_STATE_OPERATIONAL)
      return;
    ...


I think this code is unreasonably complicated.  The multiple layers
and negations make it very difficult to figure out what's definitive.

I'm not sure how mpt3sas benefits from adding
mpt3sas_base_pci_device_is_available() here, other than the fact that
it avoids an MMIO read to the device in most cases.  I think it would
be simpler and better to make mpt3sas_base_get_iocstate() smarter
about handling ~0 values from the readl().
