Ok, thanks for the clarification. I will remove the 2nd HMAC TFM then.

As you wish, I will refer to specific name of the cryptographic operation.

Correct, no overlapping.

This is the case in general for all KDFs (and even RNGs). It is no technical 
or cryptographic error to have overlapping buffers. The only issue is that the 
result will not match the expected value.

The issue is that the input buffer to the generate function is an input to 
every round of the KDF. If the input and output buffer overlap, starting with 
the 2nd iteration of the KDF, the input is the output of the 1st round. Again, 
I do not think it is a cryptographic error though.

(To support my conclusion: A colleague of mine has proposed an update to the 
HKDF specification where the input data changes for each KDF round. This 
proposal was considered appropriate by one of the authors of HKDF.)

If the requested output is smaller or equal to the output block size of the 
KDF, overlapping buffers are even harmless since the implementation will 
calculate the correct output.

Due to that, I removed the statement. But I am not sure we should add a 
technical block to deny overlapping input/output buffers.

Could you please help me why a user should set this flag? Isn't the 
implementation specifying that flag to allow identifying whether the 
implementation could or could not sleep? Thus, we simply copy the sleeping 
flag from the lower level keyed message digest implementation.

At least that is also the implementation found in crypto/hmac.c.

Could you please help me why that else branch is not needed? If the buffer to 
be generated is equal or larger than the output block length of the keyed 
message digest, I would like to directly operate on the output buffer to avoid 
a memcpy.

Why would I want to turn that buffer into a static variable? All we need it 
for is in case there is no salt provided.

I was not sure whether this approach would be acceptable. I very much would 
love to have a u32 pre-pended only without the RTA business.

I updated the implementation accordingly.

I added a check for the presence of salg->setkey.

I would not suggest this, because that rounds contrary to the concept of the 
kernel crypto API IMHO. The caller has to provide the wrapping cipher. It is 
perfectly viable to allow a caller to invoke a specific keyed message digest.

Thank you very much for your code review.
