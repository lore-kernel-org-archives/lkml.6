Well.... it's not that it's being ignored.  It's just a
misunderstanding of how a few things.  It's also that the how we
handled mount options has evolved over time, leading to a situation
which is confusing.

First, tune2fs changes the default of ext4's mount options.  This is
stated in the tune2fs man page:

-o [^]mount-option[,...]
              Set or clear the indicated default mount options in the filesys‐
              tem.   Default  mount options can be overridden by mount options
              specified either in /etc/fstab(5) or on the command  line  argu‐
              ments  to mount(8).  Older kernels may not support this feature;
              in particular, kernels which predate  2.4.20  will  almost  cer‐
              tainly ignore the default mount options field in the superblock.

Secondly, the message when af ile sytem is mounted, e.g.:

> EXT4-fs (sda1): mounted filesystem with ordered data mode. Opts: (null)

... is the mount option string that are passed to the mount system
call.

The extended mount options is different.  It was something that we
added later.  If it is present, this the extended mount options is
printed first, followed by a semi-colon, followed by string passed to
the mount system call.

Hence:

> tune2fs -E mount_opts=nodelalloc /dev/sda1
> 
> at boot we got:
> EXT4-fs (sda1): mounted filesystem with ordered data mode. Opts: nodelalloc; (null)


The description of -E option in the tune2fs man page talks about some
of this, but it's arguably confusing.

You can see exactly what mount options that are active by looking at
the file /proc/fs/ext4/<dev>/options.  So this is how you can prove to
yourself that tune2fs -o works.

So what's happening here is something that has recently started
getting reported by users.  Most modern distro's use an initial
ramdisk to mount the root file system, and they use blkid to determine
the file system with the right file system type.  If the kernel is
mounting the root file system.  An indication that this is what's
happening is the following message in dmesg:

[    2.196149] VFS: Mounted root (ext4 filesystem) readonly on device 254:0.

This message means the kernel fallback code was used to mount the file
system, not the initial ramdisk code in userspace.

If you are using the kernel fallback code, it will first try to mount
the file system as ext3, and if you have "nodelalloc" in the extended
mount options in the superblock, it will try it first.  The messages
you have quoted above are harmless.  But they are scaring users, so we
are looking into ways to suppress them.

That's because /proc/mounts is trying to emulate the user-space
maintained /etc/mtab file.  So we deliberately suppress default mount
options.  If you take out this feature:

diff --git a/fs/ext4/super.c b/fs/ext4/super.c
index 756f515b762d..e93b86f68da5 100644

 		    (!want_set && (sbi->s_mount_opt & m->mount_opt)))


... then /proc/mounts looks a lot messier, and most users would not
like the result:

/dev/vdc /vdc ext4 rw,relatime,bsddf,nogrpid,block_validity,dioread_lock,nodiscard,nodelalloc,journal_checksum,barrier,auto_da_alloc,user_xattr,acl,noquota,data=ordered 0 0

If you really want the reliable "what are the mount options right
now", the place to look is /proc/fs/ext4/<device>/options, as
described above.
