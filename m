True, anything requiring tweaking multiple downstream ports would
induce a hot-unplug/replug for each.  A better sysfs interface would
allow multiple downstream ports to be updated in a single shot.

OTOH, I think the only sensible way to dynamically adjust groups is
through hotplug, we cannot have running drivers attached to downstream
endpoints as we're adjusting the routing.  Thanks,
