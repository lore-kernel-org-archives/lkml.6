You're absolutely right.  That was appropriate for email (where I
originally posted this) but certainly not for the tree.

I was trying to make the point that whenever we're doing *anything* in
a shared project like Linux, it's better to look at existing practice
and follow it than it is to slavishly follow rules.

So I purposely didn't enumerate all the cases.  I think if you look at
logs of individual files, they're pretty consistent.  I generally use
"PCI/XXX" for things in the core (mostly capabilities like MSI, AER,
DPC, etc) and "PCI: xxx:" for drivers (shpchp, pciehp, etc).  IIRC, I
adopted this from previous practice.

Of course there are things I don't apply that are different.  And
Rafael does most of the PM stuff, so I try to follow *his* convention
for that.

It's useful as an archive and for people not subscribed to linux-pci
who happen to see the occasional thing they want to respond to.
Nobody expects to be able to follow everything on LKML.
get_maintainer.pl reports LKML for everything, and I'm not trying to
innovate by being different.

But on reflection, I think the overall value of this writeup is
minimal.  It's a lot of repetition of things already documented
elsewhere and most of it boils down to "pay attention to existing
practice and don't do things differently unless you're innovating and
adding value."  That *should* be obvious, and if it's not, I doubt
that adding one more thing to read is going to make it more obvious.
