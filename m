I can't see why CONFIG_VMAP_STACK would only work in conjunction with
CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING.

On arm64 at least, if we overflow the stack while handling a BUG(), we
*should* trigger the overflow handler as usual, and that should work,
unless I'm missing something.

Maybe it gets part-way into panic(), sets up some state,
stack-overflows, and we get wedged because we're already in a panic?
Perhaps CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING causes more stack to be used, so it dies a
little earlier in panic(), before setting up some state that causes
wedging.

... which sounds like something best fixed in those code paths, and not
here.

On arm64 at least, writing to the guard page will not itself trigger a
stack overflow, but will trigger a data abort. I suspect similar is true
on x86, if the stack pointer is sufficiently far above the guard page.

I don't think that we can choose something that's guaranteed to be
sufficient for BUG() handling and also not wasting a tonne of space
under normal operation.

Let's figure out what's going wrong on x86 in the case that you mention,
and try to solve that.

Here I don't think we should reserve space at all -- it's completely
arbitrary, and as above we can't guarantee that it's sufficient anyway.

On arm64, this won't trigger our stack overflow handler, unless the SP
is already very close to the boundary.

Please just use BUG(). If there is an issue on x86, it would be good to
solve that in the x86 code.

I really don't think we should bother with this arbitrary offset at all.

Thanks,
Mark.
