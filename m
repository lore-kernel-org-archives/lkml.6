Fun bit of paranoia: I added early checks to devm_kmalloc() too in
another patch after 0-day started yelling about other things, and this
morning while removing the SIZE_MAX checks based on your feedback, I
discovered:

void * devm_kmalloc(struct device *dev, size_t size, gfp_t gfp)
{
        struct devres *dr;

        /* use raw alloc_dr for kmalloc caller tracing */
        dr = alloc_dr(devm_kmalloc_release, size, gfp, dev_to_node(dev));
...

static __always_inline struct devres * alloc_dr(dr_release_t release,
                                               size_t size, gfp_t gfp, int nid)
{
       size_t tot_size = sizeof(struct devres) + size;
        struct devres *dr;

        dr = kmalloc_node_track_caller(tot_size, gfp, nid);
...

which is exactly the pattern I was worried about: SIZE_MAX plus some
small number would overflow. :(

So, I've added an explicit overflow check in devm_kmalloc() now.

Thoughts: making {struct,array,array3}_size() return "SIZE_MAX -
something" could help for generic cases (like above), but it might
still be possible in a buggy situation for an attacker to choose
factors that do NOT overflow, but reach something like "SIZE_MAX - 1"
and then the later addition will wrap it around. I'm leaning towards
doing it anyway, though, since not all factors in a given bug may have
very high granularity, giving us better protection than SIZE_MAX.

However, since now we're separating overflow checking from saturation
(i.e. we could calculate a non-overflowing value that lands in the
saturation zone), we can't sanely to the check_*_overflow() cases,
since the "saturated" results from array_size() aren't SIZE_MAX any
more...

I can't decide which is a safer failure case...

Not sure; my new patches drop it entirely since they're redefining
*calloc() and *_array*() with the helpers now...

I'll send a v2 shortly (without the treewide changes, since those are
huge and only changed slightly with some 0-day noticed glitches).
