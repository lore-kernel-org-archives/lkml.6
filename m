Not sure how relevant this is, but I had emailed the list earlier in the
month reporting totally bogus fs/SATA errors following an fstrim in
4.19.  I didn't have much information to add, as the logs were all lost,
and I didn't have any interest in trying to reproduce it on my daily
driven laptop.

I've just been running 4.17 since then (4.18 has some annoying i915 drm
bugs), and things have been perfectly fine in the storage/filesystem
department.

What I had noticed as being suspect back then was the following:

$ git tag --contains 744889b7cbb56a6
v4.19
v4.19.1
v4.19.2
v4.19.3
v4.19.4
v4.19.5
v4.20-rc1
v4.20-rc2
v4.20-rc3
v4.20-rc4
$ git tag --contains 1adfc5e4136f5967
v4.20-rc2
v4.20-rc3
v4.20-rc4
$

Since the 744889b7 commit message talks specifically about discard, and
1adfc5e4 claims to fix 744889b7, I assumed it was probably responsible
considering the tags profile, but did not try understand the commits or
bisect.

FYI the machine I observed this on is a SATA-attached SSD (Samsung 840
EVO 250G) X61s.  I only run fstrim manually, but of course with discard
enabled all the way down the lvm+dmcrypt stack.

Maybe that's of use in hunting down this bug.  If nobody else bisects in
the coming weeks I'll have to reconsider the rigamarole of backups,
repro, and attempting a bisect.

Vito Caputo
