- It is compatible with what the AP BUS shows
- a cut and past is easy
- you can use a userland script to translate to another format

- this is not compatible with what the AP BUS shows
- as in the first case this is easy to parse

Both propositions look better to me.

what is the point of seeing what the matrix looks like ?
It is interesting for the developer not for the administrator.
What the administrator needs is:
- To assign AP and to see what has been assigned
- To assign domains and to see what has been assigned

OK, bad word, "effective", replace with "really".

We do not implement any kind of provisioning nor do we implement update
of the CRYCB at any point after the first mediated device open.

Binding a queue and updating the mask can be done at any time (may be we 
should change this ?)

What is the point of showing a matrix which will never be used by the guest?
