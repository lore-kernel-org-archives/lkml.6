I'm not happy with that either, but the alternative would be to
rename almost every instance of POLL... in the tree.  All of them
except for poll.h, actually.  And then keep playing whack-a-mole
for resurfacing POLL... in drivers.

Sure, we can do that, but at least let's do that as a single
search-and-replace job in -rc1.  Too many conflicts otherwise.
No need to invent KPOLLIN et.al. - we have perfectly usable
EPOLLIN and friends.

A bit of a problem in places like
                        mask & POLLOUT ? "POLLOUT" : "",
but it's not too terrible.  I'll experiment a bit - should be able to
post a script to run.

As for the place for mangle/demangle... where would you prefer them?
