...here's my take on this whole situation:

So far as I can tell, this syzbot daemon grew the ability to fuzz
filesystems and started emitting bug report after bug report, with
misleading commit ids that have nothing to do with the complaint.  Your
maintainers (Dave, Eric, and me) have spent a few hours trying to figure
out what's going on, to some frustration.  The bug reports themselves
miss the public engagement detail of saying something like "Hey XFS
engineers, if you'd like to talk to the syzbot engineers they can be
reached at <googlegroup address>."  Instead it merely says "direct
questions to <addr>" like this is some press release and the only thing
on the other end of the line will be some disinterested bureaucracy.
Or some robot.

We're willing to take random user reports of corruption and misbehavior
and do all the work to turn that into regression tests and patches, but
that's not the situation here.  You work for a well known engineering
company which (I assume) has decided that fuzz hardening the commons
aligns with its goals.  Collective-you (i.e. your company) could realize
that goal sooner and with a lot less community friction by staffing up
engineers to join our community to help us triage and fix the things
reported by syzbot.  It's much /less/ effective to dump a pile of work
on the people in the community.  We each have our own work-piles and
most likely different priorities.

Hardening XFS to the sorts of things fuzzers find is important to me
(and $employer) as well, but the difference here is that I read every
report that gets generated and start the work to figure out a regression
test and a code fix.  That is what I send to the list for more public
participation and to signal that yes, there's a human behind all this
with some reasonable level of understanding of the problem.
