OK if Tegra PMC inverts the PMIC interrupt coming in from palmas as
active-high to active-low for PMC, and then PMC again inverts it
from active-low to active-high for GIC then it makes sense.

The only option that works for omap5 at palmas end is if
PALMAS_POLARITY_CTRL_INT_POLARITY is cleared. Setting the SoC internal
pulls does not make a difference, so I suspect there is either some
unknown pull-up/pull-down configuration register in palmas, or there
is an external pull resistor.

But as dra7 is using a gpio interrupt, I'll just change omap5 to use
gpio_wk16 instead of sys_nirq1 too. Will send out a patch shortly.

Regards,

Tony
