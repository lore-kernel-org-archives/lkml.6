The MIC driver as a whole is uninteresting as a generic interface since
it is quite tied to the Intel hardware.  The VOP parts though are
logically separated and have no relation to that hardware, even if the
ioctls are called MIC_VIRTIO_*.

The samples/mic/mpssd/mpssd.c code handles both the boot of the MIC
(sysfs) and the VOP parts (ioctls).

pcie-endpoint is a generic framework that allows Linux to act as an
endpoint and set up the BARs, etc.  mic appears to have Intel
MIC-specific code for this (pre-dating pcie-endpoint) but this is
separate from the vop code.  pcie-endpoint and vop do not have
overlapping functionality and can be used together.

I'm not familiar with NTB, but from a quick look it seems to be tied to
special hardware, and I don't see any virtio-related code there.  A vop
backend for NTB-backend would presumably work to allow virtio
functionality there.
