My question was more along the line of "do we actually want to
_generate_ a deferred cc1 or unsolicited interrupt, based upon what we
do in our state machine". My guess is no, regardless of the changes you
do in this series.

I'm a big fan of just throwing everything at the hardware and let it
sort out any races etc. We just need to be sure we don't mix up
interrupts :)
