This isn't something that is easily caught upfront.  Yes we can all be
busy little beavers with pahole to audit alignment.  But chances are
most people won't do it.

Reality is there is potential for a regression due to false sharing to
creep in if a hot struct member suddenly starts straddling a cacheline.
That type of NUMA performance killer is pretty insidious and somewhat
tedious to hunt down even when looking for it with specialized tools:
