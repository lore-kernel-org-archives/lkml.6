I knew there had to be a pretty tight coupling between the NVMe driver's
native multipathing and ANA support... and that the simplicity of
Hannes' patch [1] was too good to be true.

The real justification for not making Hannes' change is it'd effectively
be useless without first splitting out the ANA handling done during NVMe
request completion (NVME_SC_ANA_* cases in nvme_failover_req) that
triggers re-reading the ANA log page accordingly.

So without the ability to drive the ANA workqueue to trigger
nvme_read_ana_log() from the nvme driver's completion path -- even if
nvme_core.multipath=N -- it really doesn't buy multipath-tools anything
to have the NVMe driver export the ana state via sysfs, because that ANA
state will never get updated.

Even though I'm frustrated I was clearly too harsh and regret my tone.
I promise to _try_ to suck less.

This dynamic of terse responses or no responses at all whenever NVMe
driver changes to ease multipath-tools NVMe support are floated is the
depressing gift that keeps on giving.  But enough excuses...

Not holding my breath BUT:
if decoupling the reading of ANA state from native NVMe multipathing
specific work during nvme request completion were an acceptable
advancement I'd gladly do the work.
