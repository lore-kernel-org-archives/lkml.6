Yeh :( This one was created to satisfy real customer use case.
So we'll have to carry it internally any way, but having it in LKML will 
allow to involve broader number of people in review, testing and fixing.
And the same code will have to be part of dsa switch driver also - it 
will be just more stable at time of migration to dsa.

+1. Hope this work will be started as soon as possible.
