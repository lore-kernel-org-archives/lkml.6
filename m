I don't have a PCIe analyzer (unless thats just a piece of software I
could download). Maybe I should have included a cover letter about what
exactly is happening in my testing:

I am using PCI passthough with various wireless hardware, all of which
worked fine except this Ath9k card. If I tried to pass through this
card my host machine would completely lock up/freeze when starting the
VM, and I would have to hard reboot. I asked on the linux-wireless
mailing list (since it seemed to be specific to the Ath9k card) and it
was suggested to add that line to quirks.c, which did resolve the
issue.

Beyond that, its really all I know. I am not at all knowledgeable about
how PCI actually works :) (or really what this patch is even doing).
Since it was so simple and fixed my issue I figured I should try and
upstream it.

I wish I could be of more help hardware wise. If there is anything
software wise I could run to get more info I can do that.

Thanks,
James
