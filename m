C11 is a n1570, ISO/IEC 9899:2011 ? (according to wiki).  Found pdf on
the web contains similar lines, so should not be any differences for
that particular case.

Then I do not understand what are the differences between "side effects
are completed" and "code generated".  Abstract machine state should
provide some guarantees between sequence points, e.g.:

    foo();    /* function call */
    ------------|
    *a = 1;     |
    *b = 12;    | Compiler in his right to reorder.
    *c = 123;   |
    ------------|
    boo();    /* function call */

compiler in his right to reorder memory accesses between foo() and
boo() calls (foo and boo are sequence points, but memory accesses
are not), but:

   foo();    /* function call */
   *(volatile int *)a = 1;
   *(volatile int *)b = 12;
   *(volatile int *)c = 123;
   boo();    /* function call */

are all sequence points, so compiler can't reorder them.

Where am I mistaken?

Yes, that is clear: we are talking about code reordering in one
particular function in a single threaded environment.
