Both tracing the functions per se and tracing their outcome has its
benefits IME.

Tracing what userspace expects us to do has its benefits as well (i.e.
do we get mainly ssch? unexpected amounts of csch? etc.). I find it
useful to be able to get this information from the vfio-ccw layer
already.

I'd not worry about that.

FWIW, for kvm/s390 I tried to do the following:
- one set of tracepoints for things that are mandated by the
  architecture and therefore expected to be stable
- and another set of tracepoints for implementation details that have a
  good change of changing

Whatever you think is useful. Of course, we can go there step by step
(and I'd really advise to do so; getting some useful info right now and
not holding things up until we have a more complete understand what
would be useful for e.g. ffdc).

You can always have userspace enable tracing of some things by default
and leave the rest off until wanted.

Basically, what userspace requests us to do.

The cio fsm simply dates back to the 2.5 era.
