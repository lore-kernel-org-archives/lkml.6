I actually agree that Google should doing more, but I think you're also shooting
the messenger.  The fact is that these bugs exist, a not-insignificant number of
which are exploitable security vulnerabilities, and *everyone* needs to be doing
more to address them.  I'm not sure you're aware, but Google employees have
already fixed around 200 syzkaller/syzbot reported bugs in the last 6 months;
that's hardly "not helping to fix anything".  Unfortunately it's still not
enough to even keep up with the rate of new bugs being reported, so we need to
be doing more still.  (And for context, as at other companies it's unfortunately
difficult to get organizational support for kernel-wide work; I'm not actually
on the syzbot team and have so far ended up working quite a bit on this in my
"free time" on this, fixing 35+ bugs, because I care, and I know that other
people care too, about the security and reliability of the Linux kernel.)

But even with more resources, the kernel is a huge project and there are always
going to be some subsystems without in-house experts.  For example, AFAIK Google
doesn't use XFS for anything, and CONFIG_XFS_FS isn't even enabled in Google's
production, Android, or Chrome OS.  Given that you are actually apparently paid
to work on XFS, I'd really hope you'd have a better attitude towards receiving
XFS bug reports with reproducers.  Other maintainers have responded differently
and it's unclear why XFS is so different.  For example the F2FS maintainer
immediately fixed all the syzbot bugs that were reported to them, and
maintainers of some networking subsystems have also been very responsive and
positive about receiving bug reports.  Though, unfortunately there seems to be a
lot of de-facto unmaintained code in the kernel too (or alternatively: Andrew
and Linus are the "maintainers"), so I will at least give you more credit than
that :-)

Now, if you *really* don't want syzbot to report XFS bugs as you believe XFS
contains known unfixable bugs or for other reasons, you can formally ask Dmitry
to remove CONFIG_XFS_FS from the syzbot config.  But of course that doesn't make
the bugs go away, it just makes the bug reports go away; you'll have to fix them
eventually anyway, one way or another.  I do think you're drastically
underestimating how useful the syzbot bug reports can be too -- note e.g. that
the bug Dave fixed by "fs: don't scan the inode cache before SB_BORN is set"
took only 3 days to be reported by syzbot after it gained support for mounting
XFS filesystems.  AFAICS that bug was in XFS for 7 years and was causing
production systems to mysteriously crash (very rarely), yet it took syzbot only
3 days to send you a C reproducer.

This is only at the early stage too --- syzkaller doesn't know how to fuzz the
XFS-specific ioctls yet, for example, but it could be taught.  It's already been
finding ext4 bugs that allowed anyone with access to an ext4 directory to
corrupt the filesystem and crash the kernel.  And note that syzkaller is
coverage-guided, using CONFIG_KCOV, so it *will* find bugs that you never
thought to test for in manually written (fuzz) tests.  Non-coverage-guided
fuzzers are no longer state of the art.  I've been really amazed at the bugs
syzkaller been able to find in other kernel subsystems, e.g. obscure races that
no one would have ever thought to test for.

Anyone is welcome to contribute to syzkaller and syzbot too; all the code is on
Github and Apache licensed.  AFAIK the only thing missing from the git repo is a
few configuration files that control how the specific syzbot installation that
Dmitry is running is set up (like how many VMs to use, the credentials, etc.)

Anyway, I'm going to keep helping with bugs either way.  Getting into arguments
like this is just a waste of time, and distracts from the real work getting
done.

Thanks,

- Eric
