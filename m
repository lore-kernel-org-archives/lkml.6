Yes, that is also my standpoint here.

Hi, Jerome,

Just one thing, as I said in the cover letter, dma-buf requires the application
to use memory created by the driver for DMA. I did try the dma-buf way in
WrapDrive (refer to [4] in the cover letter), it is a good backup for NOIOMMU
mode or we cannot solve the problem in VFIO.

But, in many of my application scenario, the application already has some memory
in hand, maybe allocated by the framework or libraries. Anyway, they don't get
memory from my library, and they pass the poiter for data operation. And they
may also have pointer in the buffer. Those pointer may be used by the
accelerator. So I need hardware fully share the address space with the
application. That is what dmabuf cannot do.
