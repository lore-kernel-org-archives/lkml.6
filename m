This *may* be true, but only if we never have to patch text in the
windows:

* between exception entry and eqs_exit()

* between eqs_enter() and exception return

* between eqs_enter() and eqs_exit() in the idle loop.

If it's possible that we need to execute patched text in any of those
paths, we must IPI all CPUs in order to correctly serialize things.

Digging a bit, I also thing that our ct_user_exit and ct_user_enter
usage is on dodgy ground today.

For example, in el0_dbg we call do_debug_exception() *before* calling
ct_user_exit. Which I believe means we'd use RCU while supposedly in an
extended quiescent period, which would be bad.

In other paths, we unmask all DAIF bits before calling ct_user_exit, so
we could similarly take an EL1 debug exception without having exited the
extended quiescent period.

I think similar applies to SDEI; we don't negotiate with RCU prior to
invoking handlers, which might need RCU.

As mentioned in my other reply, I don't think the ISB in do_idle()
makes sense, unless that occurs *after* we exit the extended quiescent
state.

Thanks,
Mark.
