(dropping stable@ as this is not how you send patches to stable).

I think the problem here is that IO memory can't be encrypted, at least
at the moment. Thus this patch. I believe future versions will be able
to handle encrypted IO but that's something Brijesh can correct me on.

So it is not really about the UEFI spec but about what the hardware
does/supports currently.

And I don't think that change matters on anything else besides AMD with
SEV enabled...

Thx.
