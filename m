Wow this is late.  If 4.16-final happens this Sunday, the most this
would possibly be in linux-next is for 1 day.  That's not ok.

If any of these are serious bug fixes, I'll consider them for 4.17-rc2,
so please send them after 4.17-rc1 is out.  And also send the new
features/cleanups then as well, as a separate series so I know to keep
them apart.

Next time please try to submit stuff sooner, there is no reason you
should not send them to me whenever they are ready, do not sit on them
at all if possible.

thanks,

greg k-h
