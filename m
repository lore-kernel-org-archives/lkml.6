Ok, I start to understand. So no, no public spec. I am an Intel employee,
I used to maintain the WiFi driver (iwlwifi). I don't know much about PCI though.
I am definitely not asking you to reverse engineer our device :)
I can try to ask internally what could be going on.
The reason I haven't done so so far and reached out to you is because I am not
aware about switches that we need to toggle to make the device magically
show up. So I thought it'd be related to the PCI core, which take me to the next point...

Ok, thanks. So I understand from you that you didn't see any weird log from the
PCI core saying: "I can see this device, but I can't enumerate it because XYZ".
I tried to look for such a thing but couldn't.

From this point, I guess I can't do much either. I'll try to get info internally.
