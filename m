Corrupting RSP and RBP as opposed to the stack memory seems much less
likely since the enclave would have to poke into the save state area.
And as much as I dislike the practice of intentionally manipulating
SSA.RSP, preventing the user from doing something because we're "helping"
doesn't seem right.

Running a checksum on the stack for every exit doesn't seem like it'd
be worth the effort, especially since this type of bug should be quite
rare, at least in production environments.

If we want to pursue the checksum idea I think the easiest approach
would be to combine it with an exit_handler and do a simple check on
the handler.  It'd be minimal overhead in the fast path and would flag
cases where invoking exit_handle() would explode, while deferring all
other checks to the user.

E.g. something like this:

Agreed, I would say even more likely.  But the idea is that the
exit_handler is called on any exit, not just exceptions.
