I'm happy to hear that!

Yes, that should be doable. I'll split them out in the next version.

They were chosen empirically. We started out with the loadavg window
sizes, but had to reduce them for exactly the reason you mention -
they're way too coarse to detect acute pressure buildup.

10s has been working well for us. We could make it smaller, but there
is some worry that we don't have enough samples then and the average
becomes too erratic - whereas monitoring total= directly would allow
you to detect accute spikes and handle this erraticness explicitly.

Let me know how it works out in your tests.

Thanks for your feedback.
