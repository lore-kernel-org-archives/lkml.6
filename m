I agree with Linus on that one. When I initially proposed the gpio
bitbanging API I had something more advanced in mind where the GPIO
framework would be responsible for toggling the GPIOs on its own when
it's given an array of bytes to transmit (this way you avoid going
back and forth between the GPIO user and the GPIO framework). But this
approach would clearly be more invasive than what you propose
here (turning the int array into a bitmap and optimizing). So, if we go
for the "int array -> bitmap" approach I think all users should be
converted so that we end up with a single API.

What we call a bitmap is an array of unsigned longs each entry
containing NBITS_PER_LONG bits, so yes, it's an arbitrary size (see the
bitmap API here [1]).

I could only find one user, and it's the core itself (for the ioctl),
so that shouldn't be too hard to convert all users. Did you find more.

I think the API should be the same and the framework should decide to
take the fast path if all gpios belong to the same chip (which AFAICT
is already the case, except it's putting the result in an int array
instead of a bitmap)

I'd still like to see how far we are from the initial perfs (the one
poking the GPIO regs directly) with this approach, and what's the
improvement compared to the int array solution we already have in place.
