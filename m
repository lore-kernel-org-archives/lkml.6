Fully agree, but: There are no publicly available datasheets and only
source for such magic is the r8168 vendor driver and trial&error.

In addition the driver supports ~ 50 chip variants and not all variants
(unfortunately nobody except Realtek knows which) are affected by the
problem. Maybe the involved Realtek guys can shed some light on this.
