Right, I wasn't talking about the MIC driver here, just the VOP
stuff. Since that comes with an ioctl interface that you want to keep
using on other hardware, this still means we have to review if it is
a good fit as a general-purpose API.

What we need to find out though is whether the combination of vop
with pcie-endpoint provides a good abstraction for what users
actually need when want to use e.g. a virtio-net connection on top
of PCIe endpoint hardware.

Correct, and again we have to see if this is a good interface. The NTB
and PCIe-endpoint interfaces have a number of differences and a
number of similarities. In particular they should both be usable with
virtio-style drivers, but the underlying hardware differs mainly in how
it is probed by the system: an NTB is seen as a PCI device attached
to two host bridges, while and endpoint is typically a platform_device
on one side, but a pci_dev on the other side.

Can you describe how you expect a VOP device over NTB or
PCIe-endpoint would get created, configured and used?
Is there always one master side that is responsible for creating
virtio devices on it, with the slave side automatically attaching to
them, or can either side create virtio devices? Is there any limit on
the number of virtio devices or queues within a VOP device?
