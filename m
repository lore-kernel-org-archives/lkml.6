The syntax of this sentence is a little tortured.  Suggestion:

	... whether or not a read from a given variable and a later
	write to that same variable are ordered.

Same syntax issue as above.

Doesn't say whether the test should be allowed.  This is true of several
other litmus tests too.

Does "unordered (via smp_mb())" mean that the test uses smp_mb() to
"unorder" the accesses, or does it mean that the test doesn't use smp_mb()
to order the accesses?

Note that the outcome of this test will be changed by one of the
patches in our "pending" list.
