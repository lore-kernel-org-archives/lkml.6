That's what I meant and I assume that's reason why the
*_prepare/unprepare() API are allowed to sleep, waiting for
an event to trigger.

I have no idea either, that's why I asked the clock maintainers too,
the point is, the clk API allows this behaviour, I do not think it is safe
to rely on a non-blocking clk back-end, that's why I raised the question
in the first place.

It looks like this patch (and more code in the kernel) expects either
the clk calls not to block or the action handler implemented in the
clock back-ends to run in S2R-NOIRQ (possibly by using the
IRQF_NO_SUSPEND flag).

I would appreciate if the clock maintainers can shed some light on
this.
