Then the user has a disaster on their hands because they have
multiple failing disks.

Yup, user needs to fix their storage before the filesystem can
attempt recovery.

So more magic numbers to define complex behaviours? :P

We can get ETIMEDOUT, ENOLINK, EBUSY and EAGAIN from the block layer
which all indicate temporary errors (see blk_errors[]). Whether the
specific storage layers are actually using them is another matter...

If we have a mirror based retries, we should probably consider EIO
as "try next mirror", not as a hard failure.

Don't care - have the storage fix itself, then check what comes
back and fix it from there.

I suspect the answer there is through the AIO interfaces....
