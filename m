This patch exports the host capabilities to debugfs

This idea of sharing host capabilities over debugfs
came up from Abbas Raza <Abbas_Raza@mentor.com>

Changes in v9
- More code cleanup as suggested by Andy Shevchenko.

Changes in v8
- Changes to use for_each_set_bit as suggested by Andy Shevchenko.

Changes in v7
- Moved additional capabilities also to caps file as mentioned by Ulf Hansson
- compacting the code with macros

Changes in v6:
- Used DEFINE_SHOW_ATTRIBUTE

Changes in v5:
- Added parser logic in kernel by using debugfs_create_file  for caps and caps2 instead of debugfs_create_x32
- Changed Author

Changes in v4:
- Moved the creation of nodes to mmc_add_host_debugfs
- Exported caps2
- Renamed host_caps to caps

Changes in v3:
- Removed typecasting of &host->caps to (u32 *)

Changes in v2:
- Changed Author
