Yes, I now good a photo of one of those boot failures I mentioned, at it seems 
to be related to blk-mq, as the backtrace contains "blk_mq_terminate_expired".

I add the screenshot to my bug report.

[Possible REGRESSION, 4.16-rc4] Error updating SMART data during runtime and 
boot failures with blk_mq_terminate_expired in backtrace
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199077

Hans, I will test your LPM policy horkage for Crucial m500 patch at a later 
time. I first wanted to add the photo of the boot failure to the bug report.

Ming and Bart, I added you to cc, cause I had to do with you about another 
blk-mq report, please feel free to adapt.

Thanks,
