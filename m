Hi people,

this is an attempt to see whether gcc's inline asm heuristic when
estimating inline asm statements' cost for better inlining can be
improved.

AFAIU, the problematic arises when one ends up using a lot of inline
asm statements in the kernel but due to the inline asm cost estimation
heuristic which counts lines, I think, for example like in this here
macro:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeature.h#n162

the resulting code ends up not inlining the functions themselves which
use this macro. I.e., you see a CALL <function> instead of its body
getting inlined directly.

Even though it should be because the actual instructions are only a
couple in most cases and all those other directives end up in another
section anyway.

The issue is explained below in the forwarded mail in a larger detail
too.

Now, Richard suggested doing something like:

 1) inline asm ("...")
 2) asm ("..." : : : : <size-expr>)
 3) asm ("...") __attribute__((asm_size(<size-expr>)));

with which user can tell gcc what the size of that inline asm statement
is and thus allow for more precise cost estimation and in the end better
inlining.

And FWIW 3) looks pretty straight-forward to me because attributes are
pretty common anyways.

But I'm sure there are other options and I'm sure people will have
better/different ideas so feel free to chime in.

Thx.
