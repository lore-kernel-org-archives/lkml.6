As I mentioned at the end of my summary (and in my first reply to this
0th header): it is on the "other" multipath toolchain to deal with
switching from "native" to "other" (by writing to 'mpath_personality').
For dm-multipath, it is multipathd that would trigger the switch from
"native" to "other" iff user opts-in by configuring multipath.conf to
own a particular NVMe subsystem's multipathing.

So users very likely won't ever have a need to write to
'mpath_personality'.  And as such, they'll just default to using
"native" NVMe multipath.

TBD really.  We are keen to enable CONFIG_NVME_MULTIPATH to allow users
to use native (as the default!).  But we won't be able to do that unless
we have this patchset.  Because we really do _need_ to give our users
the option of continuing to use dm-multipath.

And as the Red Hat employee who would have to port it to each kernel (as
long as there is a need): _please_ don't make me do that.

PLEASE! ;)
