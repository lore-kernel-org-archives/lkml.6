Not sure why, it's not so much a platform issue today. It's qemu itself
who by defaults bypasses any iommu. I suppose ppc64 stood out because
unlike x86 we always have an iommu by default.

Anyway, Anshuman, I think that's the right approach, first make virtio
always use the DMA API with a quirk early to override the ops.

Christoph: the overriding of the ops isn't a platform thing. It's a
qemu thing, ie, from a Linux perspective, it's a feature of the
"device". So it should be done in virtio itself, not the platform code.

However, we do want the ability in platform code to force the bounce
buffering to solve our secure VM issue.

Cheers,
Ben.
