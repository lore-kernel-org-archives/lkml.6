Correct, disable the shared interrupt line keeps all devices using
that line from working, which is current kernel's behavior w/o this
quirk handling: it disables the (shared) interrupt line after 100.000+
generated interrupts. But the side effect is that other devices become
unusable after that (eg: USB devices which share the same interrupt
line with the Intel GPU). That's why the original commit, f67fd55fa96f
("PCI: Add quirk for still enabled interrupts on Intel Sandy Bridge
GPUs") disables the GPU's interrupt directly, which should really be
done by the VGA BIOS itself (a buggy VBIOS!).

The symptom was described briefly in the original commit f67fd55fa96f
too, that disables the (shared) interrupt line after 100.000+
generated interrupts (can be observed via /proc/interrupts).

I don't have a relatively newer Intel board at hand for testing right
now. I can try to locate one. But as I said, it's highly possible at
least all 1st/2nd/3rd generation Core processors are affected. Maybe
we can add all these known GPU devices of  1st/2nd/3rd generation Core
processors all together for now? For newer GPUs, let's wait until
someone reports the issue again?

I suspect Windows cannot handle it too. Without the GPU awareness, the
interrupt line is simply on and no driver claims the devices and will
cause issues. I can test this.
