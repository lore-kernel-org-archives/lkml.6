The difference should be made by commit 923218f6166a84 (blk-mq: don't
allocate driver tag upfront for flush rq), which releases driver tag
before requeuing the request, but that is definitely the correct thing
to do.

This mechanism is invented by blk-mq, and I guess it is for avoiding to
disable irq when acquiring hctx->lock since blk-mq's completion handler
is done in irq context.

Legacy's requeue won't re-insert one request to scheduler queue.

Right, once .queue_rq() returns BLK_STS_RESOURCE, this rq is added to
hctx->dispatch list, and finally it will be completed via driver or
timeout handler, or it may be re-inserted to io scheduler queue via
blk_mq_requeue_request() by driver in driver's completion handler.

So io scheduler will get the notification finally.

As I explained, io scheduler will get notified via either
.finish_request or .requeue_request finally, so there shouldn't be
such block if this patch is in.

BFQ still can get notified via .requeue_request when one request is re-inserted
to BFQ with this patch.

Right.

I agree. We should deal with this issue in a simple/clean way, just like
the patch of 'block: kyber: fix domain token leak during requeue'.

Now could you please let us know if you are fine with the patch of 'blk-mq:
don't call io sched's .requeue_request when requeueing rq to ->dispatch'?


Thanks,
