My existing patch already does this, and I've added a note to the changelog
as well now.

Ok, done. I've listed you as 'Suggested-by' for that patch. Since the
changelog is way more work than the actual change, I would have
made you the author of that patch, but I don't have a Signed-off-by
from you for it.
