Not authorized. :-)

OK, I'll wait for your submission.

That was my concern, too. On the other hand, the TCP specific waiting
code in inet_stream_connect() makes me wonder if it wouldn't be cleaner
to move it into the TCP specific handler as well (which is something
this approach would allow).

Yes, that should do the trick (and makes backporting to distribution
kernels with frozen kABI much easier). I guess I was too fixed on the
split between proto_ops::connect and proto::connect to see this
solution.
