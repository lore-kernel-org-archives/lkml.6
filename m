I agree, entirely excluding bus resets is not something to be taken
lightly.  It's less than ideal for an endpoint and a fairly major
functional gap for a downstream port.  It should really be considered
a last resort.

Tweaking the delay would be a reasonable solution, though we are seeing
some issues where users with lots of assigned devices that require bus
resets experience long delays as vfio file descriptors are closed
sequentially on exit.  So perhaps we could flag downstream ports
requiring an extra delay, if that becomes a solution.  Your mention of
the bus/device number also reminds me of the issue we saw on
Threadripper where there were patches proposed to re-write the
secondary and subordinate bus numbers after reset.  AMD was able to
resolve that in a firmware update, but there could be something similar
occurring here. Thanks,

Alex
