They'll do that when we provide them with a safe, easy to use
solution to the problem. This is our problem to solve, not
blame-shift it away.

Yup, that's to make it easy for virtual kernel filesystems to be
mounted inside containers, and to solve some of FUSEs security
issues caused by needing root permissions to mount FUSE filesystems.

Enabling unprivileged mounts requires an opt-in flag in the
filesystem fs-type definition, and we most certainly won't be
setting that flag on XFS. I also doubt it will ever get set on any
other existing block device based filesystem because of the trust
model problems it exposes.

So your solution is to have VM guests and container users spin up
sandboxed VMs to access filesystem images safely? That's not really
a practical solution. :/

That may be true, but it's so much better than using the kernel to
parse untrusted filesystem metadata.

Except there is now fusefs-lkl, so all kernel filesystem are fully
accessible through FUSE.

Been trying to get security people to understand this for years.
I've given up because there's always some new security person who
follows The Process and simply does not understand that there is a
difference.

Cheers,
