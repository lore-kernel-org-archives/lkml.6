Yes, indeed. All too well. ;)

I did some forensic on this and it seems this problem has "always" been
there. Specifically, closed ports have never been runtime suspended
unless a non-negative autosuspend delay has been set by user space since
fcdca75728ac ("ARM: OMAP2+: UART: Add runtime pm support for omap-serial
driver") which was merged seven years ago.

So while it would certainly be nice to save some more power by default,
this would really be a new feature rather than a bug or regression fix
(which reduces the urgency for this issue somewhat too).

Yeah, that would be too much of a hack and likely wouldn't work either
(and we really should do away with those _force calls altogether).

I've been thinking a bit too much about this already, but it may be
possible to use the pm QoS framework for this. A resume latency can be
set through sysfs where "n/a" is defined to mean "no latency accepted"
(i.e. controller remains always-on while port is open) and "0" means
"any latency accepted" (i.e. omap aggressive serial RPM is allowed).

Now, implementing this may get a little tricky as we want to be able to
change this setting on the fly (consider consoles) and we need to figure
out the interaction with serdev (user space should probably not be
allowed to request a resume latency for ports used by serdev).

I'd be happy to dig into this some more, but not in my spare time I'm
afraid.

Yes, user space may override the default settings provided by the serial
driver, but a serdev driver, in contrast, knows nothing about the
underlying serial hardware.

Yep, status quo works for the time being (since this isn't a
regression).

As mentioned above, PM QoS resume latency may possibly be used, and
otherwise me may able to define a new (generic) QoS flag for this.

Not RPM blocked; the ports must always be able to suspend when the port
is closed. But user space should be able to enable the aggressive
(active) runtime PM via sysfs independently of the autosuspend delay,
yes.

Johan
