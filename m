Missing "power-domains = <&sysc R8A7795_PD_ALWAYS_ON>;", as
the Secure Engine is part of the CPG/MSSR clock domain (see below [*]).

Indeed. From a quick glance, it looks like drivers/crypto/ccree/cc_driver.c
does not distinguish between the absence of the clock property, and an
actual error in getting the clock, and never considers any error a failure
(incl. -PROBE_DEFER).

As of_clk_get() returns -ENOENT for both a missing clock property and a
missing clock, you should use (devm_)clk_get() instead, and distinguish
between NULL (no clock property) and IS_ERR() (actual failure -> abort).

Hence in the absence of the clock patch, the driver accesses the crypto
engine while its module clock is turned off, leading to:

    ccree e6601000.crypto: Invalid CC signature: SIGNATURE=0x00000000
!= expected=0xDCC63000

You must be lucky, though, usually you get an imprecise external abort
later, crashing the whole system ;-)

So I think this patch should be dropped for now.

However, even with your clock patch, the signature checking fails for me,
on both R-Car H3 ES1.0 and ES2.0.
Does this need changes to the ARM Trusted Firmware, to allow Linux to
access the public SCEG module?

[*] More on the subject of clock control:
At least for Renesas SoCs, where the module is part of a clock domain, and
can be controlled automatically by Runtime PM, you could drop the explicit
clock control, and use Runtime PM instead
(pm_runtime_{enable,get_sync,put,disable}()).  That would allow the driver
to work on systems with any kind of PM Domains, too.
Depending on the other platforms that include a CryptoCell and their
(non)reliance on PM Domains, you may have to keep the explicit clock
handling, in addition to Runtime PM.

To decrease power consumption, I suggest to move the clock and/or Runtime
PM handling to the routines that actually use the hardware, instead of
powering the module in the probe routine.

Thanks!
