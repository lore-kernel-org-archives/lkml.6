Currently the patch relies on the procfd inode saving a copy to the PIDTYPE_PID
pid.  I'm not sure offhand, can it go to the PIDTYPE_PGID from that after the
task has died, or not?   I didn't think so.  If it can then great.

The point is (a) these are details which should not have to bother userspace,
and (b) how to decide who we're sending the signal to (tid/pid/pgid) should
be specified in precisely one way.  So either a flag, or comign from the type
of fd that was opened.
