It's difficult for me to speak to the decisions as I can understand
your point of view, but maybe I can speak to some of the status.

We still use the port internally for kicking the tools around and other
research projects.  As you noticed we're not doing gcc anymore; we're
using LLVM for both kernel and userspace.  Yes there have been some
caveats but it does work within confines.

Time is unfortunately just limited for me to upstream some of my kernel
fixes and cleanups, and there are some things that just haven't shown
up externally yet.

However, as James Hogan mentioned, having it in the tree really has been
useful because it gets included in the various upstream changes and
fixes, which we appreciate.

So hopefully this will help inform the decision a little better.

If you have any other questions please let me know.


Thanks,
Richard Kuo
