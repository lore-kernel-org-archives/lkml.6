Like Yehezkel commented, it either is not supported or alternatively it
is (the BIOS/boot loader utilizes IOMMU as well), loads the OS image and
what is needed from the disk, disables BME (bus mastering enable) and
resets the IOMMU back to the default state before handing over to the OS.

"IOMMU blocking" does not mean that the device cannot be used at all. It
actually means that the device is immediately usable and can do DMA as
the driver has programmed (using DMA-API) but it cannot access any
memory outside of those regions the driver has programmed.

The point of this exercise is to prevent so called drive-by DMA attacks
where you go to take a cup of coffee and during that time someone plugs
in a malicous device to Thunderbolt port of your laptop and reads all
your secrets.

When IOMMU is enabled the malicous device still is usable (assuming
there is driver for it) but it cannot go and read all the memory, just
the memory driver has programmed.

So in your GPU case it should just work assuming the GPU has a driver.
