Sounds good.

Not necessarily, that depends on what callbacks you can expect and at
what time.

But i2c doesn't have the concept of an "open" port consuming power.

Haven't looked at it in any detail, but in general serdev driver should
only keep the port open while the device is in use.

I only noticed that nfc core has dev_up/down callbacks which looks like
they could be used for something like this.

> Wouldn't that be the scope of another later patch then ?

Possibly. We have accepted some serdev drivers already taking the lazy
approach of opening the port in probe. Depending on the driver, it may
not be too bad (e.g. for some specific hardware which you know you'll
always use), but it not really nice to have everyone pay a price in
terms of power-consumption for a feature that is rarely used.
