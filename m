Hi Al,

Your feedback on this new cpu_opv system call would be welcome. This series
is now aiming at the next merge window (4.17).

The whole restartable sequences series can be fetched at:

tag: v4.15-rc9-rseq-20180122

Thanks!

> NAME
>       cpu_opv - CPU preempt-off operation vector system call
> 
> SYNOPSIS

>       int cpu_opv(struct cpu_op * cpu_opv, int cpuopcnt, int cpu, int flags);
> 
> DESCRIPTION
>       The cpu_opv system call executes a vector of operations on behalf
>       of user-space on a specific CPU with preemption disabled.
> 
>       The operations available are: comparison, memcpy, add,  or,  and,
>       xor, left shift, right shift, and memory barrier. The system call
>       receives a CPU number from user-space as argument, which  is  the
>       CPU on which those operations need to be performed.  All pointers
>       in the ops must have been set up to point to the per  CPU  memory
>       of  the CPU on which the operations should be executed. The "com‐
>       parison" operation can be used to check that the data used in the
>       preparation  step  did  not  change between preparation of system
>       call inputs and operation execution within the preempt-off criti‐
>       cal section.
> 
>       An overall maximum of 4216 bytes in enforced on the sum of opera‐
>       tion length within an operation vector, so user-space cannot gen‐
>       erate  a too long preempt-off critical section. Each operation is
>       also limited a length of 4096 bytes. A maximum limit of 16 opera‐
>       tions per cpu_opv syscall invocation is enforced.
> 
>       If the thread is not running on the requested CPU, it is migrated
>       to it.
> 
>       The layout of struct cpu_opv is as follows:
> 
>       Fields
> 
>           op Operation of type enum cpu_op_type to perform. This opera‐
>              tion type selects the associated "u" union field.
> 
>           len
>              Length (in bytes) of data to consider for this operation.

>           u.compare_op
>              For a CPU_COMPARE_EQ_OP , and CPU_COMPARE_NE_OP , contains
>              the  a  and  b pointers to compare. The expect_fault_a and
>              expect_fault_b fields indicate whether a page fault should
>              be expected for each of those pointers.  If expect_fault_a
>              , or expect_fault_b is set, EAGAIN is returned  on  fault,
>              else  EFAULT is returned. The len field is allowed to take

>              For a CPU_MEMCPY_OP , contains the dst and  src  pointers,

>              and expect_fault_src fields indicate whether a page  fault
>              should  be  expected  for  each  of  those  pointers.   If
>              expect_fault_dst , or expect_fault_src is set,  EAGAIN  is

>              set, EAGAIN is returned on fault, else EFAULT is returned.
>              The  len  field  is  allowed  to take values of 1, 2, 4, 8

> RETURN VALUE
>       A return value of 0 indicates success. On error, -1 is  returned,
>       and  errno is set appropriately. If a comparison operation fails,
>       execution of the operation vector  is  stopped,  and  the  return
