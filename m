I believe it's ready to go in.  I'll need to rebase it onto cryptodev, to
resolve some small conflicts with the recent ChaCha20-related changes.  Also
I'll probably omit the fscrypt patch (patch 15/15) so that that patch can be
taken through the fscrypt tree instead.

Do you prefer that this be merged before or after Zinc?  It seems it may still
be a while before the community is satisfied with Zinc (and Wireguard which is
in the same patchset), and I don't want this blocked unnecessarily...  So on my
part I'd prefer to just have this merged as-is.

Of course, it's always possible to change the xchacha12 and xchacha20
implementations later, whether that's to use "Zinc" or otherwise.  And
NHPoly1305 and Adiantum itself will be the same either way, except that the
Poly1305 helpers may change slightly.

What do you think?

Thanks!

- Eric
