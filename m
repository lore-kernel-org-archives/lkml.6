I have strong objections to the way these bindings have been forced upon
everybody; if that's the way *generic* ACPI bindings are specified I
wonder why there still exists an ACPI specification and related working
group.

I personally (but that's Bjorn and Rafael choice) think that this is
not a change that belongs in PCI core, ACPI bindings are ill-defined
and device tree bindings are non-existing.

At the very least Microsoft should be asked to publish and discuss
these bindings within the ACPI and UEFI forums.
