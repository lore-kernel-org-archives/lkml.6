Agreed. I find a total of 590 drivers calling inb/outb and related
helpers, using "git grep -wl 'out\(l\|w\|b\)' drivers/ sound/" (there
are probably a couple more. There are hardly any among those
that one would expect to see in a modern machine:

- The majority is for ISA, PCMCIA or PCI devices, as opposed
  to PCIe, and presumably no longer sold.
- Many are de factor architecture specific, e.g. drivers for
  stuff in a PC chipset.

drivers/staging/comedi/ has some things in it that have
a slight chance of still being put into modern machines
when moving from an old embedded system to a new one,
but being staging, chances are that the drivers also require
other changes before they work on a new architecture.

Overall, I wonder if we'd be better off completely disabling
outb etc on arm64, and only supporting iomap()/ioread()/iowrite()
instead, without giving any guarantees there.
Getting there would definitely require some code changes
(and many Kconfig changes), but it still seems appealing
given how much legacy stuff we could completely ignore
afterwards.

Right.
