This is an implementation detail that should not leak to applications,
and I believe it's still considered a bug, in that, with large static
TLS, it could overflow or leave unusably little space left on an
otherwise-plenty-large application-provided stack.

Use of IE model from a .so file (except possibly libc.so or something
else that inherently needs to be present at program startup for other
reasons) should be a considered a bug and unsupported usage.
Encouraging libraries to perpetuate this behavior is going backwards
on progress that's being made to end it.

Presumably they should have registered their need for rseq too,
thereby incrementing the reference count. I'm not sure this is a good
idea, but I think I understand it now.
