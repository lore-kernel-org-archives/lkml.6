This text could be also part of the changelog, it's useful to understand
how the change is done.

So this patches looks good to me and does seem to fix the longstanding
problem of not automatically selectiong the crc32c module when btrfs is
used. IIRC this has some workaround in dracut.

The modinfo confirms that now all the module dependencies are there:

before:
depends:        zstd_compress,zstd_decompress,raid6_pq,xor,zlib_deflate

after:
depends:        libcrc32c,zstd_compress,zstd_decompress,raid6_pq,xor,zlib_deflate
