Before a6a252e64914, follows blk_mq_sched_bypass_insert()

       if (rq->tag == -1) {
               rq->rq_flags |= RQF_SORTED;
               return false;
	   }

       /*
        * If we already have a real request tag, send directly to
        * the dispatch list.
        */
       spin_lock(&hctx->lock);
       list_add(&rq->queuelist, &hctx->dispatch);
       spin_unlock(&hctx->lock);
       return true;

This function still returns false for all non-flush request, so nothing
changes wrt. this kind of handling.

This 'requeue' to hctx->dispatch is invisible to io scheduler, and from
io scheduler view, seems no difference between STS_OK and STS_RESOURCE,
since this request will be submitted to lld automatically by blk-mq
core.

Also in legacy path, no such notification to io scheduler too.

The .finish_request will be called after this request is completed for this
case, either after this io is completed by device, or timeout.

Or .requeue_request will be called if the driver need to requeue it to
io scheduler via blk_mq_requeue_request() explicitly.

So io scheduler will be made sure to get notified.

Could you explain it a bit why bfq is blocked by this way?

USB/BFQ runs well on my parted test with this change, and this test can
trigger the IO hang issue easily on kyber or without your patch of 'block,
bfq: add requeue-request hook'.
