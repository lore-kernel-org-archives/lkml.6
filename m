It seems unwieldy that this is a compile time option and not a runtime
option. Can't we have a kernel command line option to opt-in to this
behavior rather than require a wholly separate kernel image?

Why is this text added in a follow on patch and not the patch that
introduced the config option?

I'm also wondering if that command line option can take a 'bus device
function' address of a switch to limit the scope of where ACS is
disabled.
