yes technically a full mdev implementation is not necessary. If
device specific extensions will be placed within vfio module, it's
obviously straightforward. What I thought earlier was in case vfio
wants to stay device-agnostic then we probably want device
specific extensions in vendor driver which is loaded but in a 
dummy mode which simply do basic PCI initialization as vfio-pci
and then wrap vf as mdev (since vfio-pci is not the vf driver in
this scenario). It's especially useful for vendor drivers which aim
to support both mdev and sr-iov by sharing common state mgmt.
knowledge, but looks an overkill to other vendor drivers. Possibly
finally we'll allow both - simple device extensions in vfio-pci and 
complex device extensions in vendor drivers through vfio-mdev.

Thanks
