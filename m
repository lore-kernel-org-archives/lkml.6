Took me just as long :)

Note below as well on your *future* freeze_super() implementation.

Phew, so this is what we want for the in-kernel freezing so we're good
and *can* combine these then.

That's straight forward.

This is where it can get hairy. More below.

If we can agree to this, then sure. However there are two types of
possible nested calls to consider, one where the sb was already frozen
by an IOCTL, and the other where it was initiated by either another
freeze_super_excl() or another freeze_super() call which is currently
being processed. For the first type, its easy to say the device is
already frozen as such return success. If the freezing is ongoing,
we may want to wait or not wait, and this will depend on our current
use cases for freeze_bdev().

As you noted above, freeze_bdev() currently returns EBUSY if we had
the sb already frozen by ioctl_fsfreeze(). It may be a welcomed
enhancement to correct the semantics first to address the first case,
but keep the EBUSY for the other case. A secondary patch could then
add a completion mechanism and let callers decide to either wait or not.
*Iff* the caller did not opt-in to wait we keep the EBUSY return.

Seem reasonable?

I'll address the rest of the mail later.
