Here=E2=80=99s another idea: calculate some little hash or other checksum of=
 RSP, RBP, and perhaps a couple words on the stack, and do:

call __vdso_enclave_corrupted_state

If you get a mismatch after return. That function could be:

call __vdso_enclave_corrupted_state:
  ud2

And now the debug trace makes it very clear what happened.

This may or may not be worth the effort. But ISTM the enclave is almost as l=
ikely to corrupt the host state and the. EEXIT as it is to corrupt the host s=
tate and then fault.

BTW, I read through Fortanix=E2=80=99s documentation of the Windows SGX call=
ing conventions, and it seems to want RSI and RDI as out params.  Letting th=
e vDSO be used to invoke Windows-targeted enclaves seems useful.

Have fun with that.  The x86_32 compiler seems to really like having its PIC=
 register preserved, and you may get some lovely compiler errors.=
