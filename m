Subject: [PATCH 0/3] namei: implement various scoping AT_* flags
Date:   Sat, 29 Sep 2018 20:34:50 +1000

The need for some sort of control over VFS's path resolution (to avoid
malicious paths resulting in inadvertent breakouts) has been a very
long-standing desire of many userspace applications. This patchset is a
revival of Al Viro's old AT_NO_JUMPS[1] patchset with a few additions.

The most obvious change is that AT_NO_JUMPS has been split as dicussed
in the original thread, along with a further split of AT_NO_PROCLINKS
which means that each individual property of AT_NO_JUMPS is now a
separate flag:

  * Path-based escapes from the starting-point using "/" or ".." are
    blocked by AT_BENEATH.
  * Mountpoint crossings are blocked by AT_XDEV.
  * /proc/$pid/fd/$fd resolution is blocked by AT_NO_PROCLINKS (more
	correctly it actually blocks any user of nd_jump_link() because it
	allows out-of-VFS path resolution manipulation).

AT_NO_JUMPS is now effectively (AT_BENEATH|AT_XDEV|AT_NO_PROCLINKS). At
Linus' suggestion in the original thread, I've also implemented
AT_NO_SYMLINKS which just denies _all_ symlink resolution (including
"proclink" resolution).

An additional improvement was made to AT_XDEV. The original AT_NO_JUMPS
path didn't consider "/tmp/.." as a mountpoint crossing -- this patch
blocks this as well (feel free to ask me to remove it if you feel this
is not sane).

Currently I've only enabled these for openat(2) and the stat(2) family.
I would hope we could enable it for basically every *at(2) syscall --
but many of them appear to not have a @flags argument and thus we'll
need to add several new syscalls to do this. I'm more than happy to send
those patches, but I'd prefer to know that this preliminary work is
acceptable before doing a bunch of copy-paste to add new sets of *at(2)
syscalls.

One additional feature I've implemented is AT_THIS_ROOT (I imagine this
is probably going to be more contentious than the refresh of
AT_NO_JUMPS, so I've included it in a separate patch). The patch itself
describes my reasoning, but the shortened version of the premise is that
continer runtimes need to have a way to resolve paths within a
potentially malicious rootfs. Container runtimes currently do this in
userspace[2] which has implicit race conditions that are not resolvable
in userspace (or use fork+exec+chroot and SCM_RIGHTS passing which is
inefficient). AT_THIS_ROOT allows for per-call chroot-like semantics for
path resolution, which would be invaluable for us -- and the
implementation is basically identical to AT_BENEATH (except that we
don't return errors when someone actually hits the root).

I've added some selftests for this, but it's not clear to me whether
they should live here or in xfstests (as far as I can tell there are no
other VFS tests in selftests, while there are some tests that look like
generic VFS tests in xfstests). If you'd prefer them to be included in
xfstests, let me know.
