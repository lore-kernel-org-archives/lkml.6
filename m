It is generally advisable to realize that in many cases platform
validation is relative to the specific software stack the given
platform is going to ship with.  If there are hardware (firmware,
similar) features in the platform that aren't exercised by that
software stack, they may receive limited testing coverage and they may
not be reliable in practice even though the formal specification of
the hardware etc may require them to be functional.

Now, I'm not aware of any OS doing PCI-to-PCI bridge power management
in a serious way.  It is formally there in the PCI PM spec, but it is
optional and that spec itself was separate from the PCI proper in the
past.  AFAICS, PM is mandatory in PCIe only.

For this reason, there is a huge risk related to enabling PM on
PCI-to-PCI bridges which is why we don't do that.

Also nobody hadn't really done runtime PM even on PCIe in practice
before 2009 and power management of ports started to be done in the
Windows 8 time frame, presumably because of Connected Standby.  It
generally is risky to assume it to work in hardware that shipped
earlier and that's the reason for the cut-off date: we knew that there
had to be a cut-off, but there's no reliable science on how far in the
past to put it, so we chose a date relatively close to "now" with an
option to move it back if need be.

Thanks,
Rafael
