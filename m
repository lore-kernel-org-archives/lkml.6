ECN [1] was approved last November, so it's normative spec text. Sorry =0A=
if the Ukranians didn't get ahold of it yet. I'll try to explain the delta.=
=0A=
There's an in-band PD supported/disable set of bits. If 'supported' is =0A=
set, then you can set 'disable', which removes the 'logical OR" and now =0A=
PD is only out-of-band presence.=0A=

=0A=
These are both hacks right? We're declaring something untrue about the =0A=
hardware because we want to obtain a specific side-effect. BUt the =0A=
side-effects are not guaranteed not to change.=0A=
=0A=
> Would this work for you?=0A=
=0A=
I'm certain it's doable. In theory one could use the PCI ID of the DP, =0A=
and the vendor and machine names to filter the quirk. But what happens =0A=
in situations where the same PCI ID switch is used in different parts of =
=0A=
the system? You want the quirk here or not there. It quickly becomes a =0A=
shartstorm.=0A=
=0A=
I'd like a generic solution. I suspect supporting 'in-band PD disabled' =0A=
and quirking for that would be a saner way to do things. If we support =0A=
it, then we need to handle PDSC after DLLSC scenarios anyway.=0A=
