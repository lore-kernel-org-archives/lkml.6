Thank you so much for many style, formatting and other issues fixes and also for
integration of 'check_at_most_once' patch, it saved me several review iterations.

Regarding free of sg in two error paths, you were correct.
I fixed it by placing several error labels to differentiate each handling.
I also noted that reqdata_arr[b].req was not released properly, this is also fixed.
following is a diff of my fix based on your modifications.
(I can send it in a patch format, but it doesn't include a fix for Eric Biggers comments)
