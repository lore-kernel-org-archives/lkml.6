This is really interesting because it's completely the reverse of what
I would have expected.

You use INT3401 on the *older* processors, where int3401_add() is
called for any platform devices with INT3401 PNP ID:

  int3401_add(plat_dev)                   # platform/ACPI .probe
    proc_thermal_add(dev)
      adev = ACPI_COMPANION(dev)
      int340x_thermal_zone_add(adev)
	thermal_zone_device_register()

The sensors are read in this path, where thermal_zone_get_temp() is
the generic thermal entry point:

  thermal_zone_get_temp()
    tz->ops->get_temp()
      int340x_thermal_get_zone_temp()    # ops.get_temp
	acpi_evaluate_integer(..., "_TMP", ...)

The above works for any platform that supplies the INT3401 device
because the _TMP method that actually reads the sensor is supplied by
the platform firmware.

On *newer* processors, you apparently use this path:

  proc_thermal_pci_probe(pci_dev)        # PCI .probe
    pci_enable_device(pci_dev)
    proc_thermal_add(dev)
      adev = ACPI_COMPANION(dev)
      int340x_thermal_zone_add(adev)
	thermal_zone_device_register()

Except for enabling the PCI device and a BSW_THERMAL hack, this is
exactly the *SAME*: you add a thermal zone for the ACPI device and
read the sensor using ACPI _TMP methods.

But now you have to add new PCI IDs (Skylake, Broxton, CannonLake,
CoffeeLake, GeminiLake, etc) for every new platform.  This seems like
a regression, not an improvement.  What am I missing?
