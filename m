That's not what's done here AIUI.  There are also some complications to
making IOMMU groups dynamic, for instance could a downstream endpoint
already be in use by a userspace tool as ACS is being twiddled in
sysfs?  Probably the easiest solution would be that all devices
affected by the ACS change are soft unplugged before and re-added after
the ACS change.  Note that "affected" is not necessarily only the
downstream devices if the downstream port at which we're playing with
ACS is part of a multifunction device.  Thanks,

Alex
