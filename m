The recommendation is to set the "in-band PD disable" bit, and it's =0A=
possible that platform firmware may have set it at boot time (*). I'm =0A=
not sure that there is a spec-justifiable reason to not access a device =0A=
whose DLL is up, but PD isn't.=0A=
=0A=

=0A=
That's why I went for ammending pciehp_handle_presence_or_link_change(). =
=0A=
Smaller bug surface ;). What I'm thinking at this point is, keep the =0A=
patch as is, but, also check for in-band PD disable before aborting the =0A=
shutdown. Old behavior stays the same.=0A=
=0A=
I'll rework this a little bit for in-band PD disable (what's a good =0A=
acronym for that, BTW?), and then quirk those machines that are known to =
=0A=
'disable' this in hardware.=0A=
=0A=
