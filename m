I don't see what other use mincore could have, yes - even the
"debugging" use I gave is performance investigations and not hard
problems (and I probably would go straight to perf nowadays, you'd get
the info that the program doesn't use cache from the call graphs)

This is heavily workload and storage hardware dependant, so hard to give
some absolute value.

Trying with some big server, fast SSD, mysql and doing:
 # echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
 # (optional) prefetch table and innodb files
 # systemctl restart mariadb
 # time mysql -q db "select * from mytable where id in $ENTRIES" > /dev/null
 # time mysql -q db "select * from mytable where id in $ENTRIES2" > /dev/null
 # time mysql -q db "select * from mytable where id in $ENTRIES3" > /dev/null
(where ENTRIES* are lists of 1000 id, and id is indexed; the table is 8GB
for 62590661 entries so 1000 entries is approx 128KB of data out of that
file)

I get on average over a few queries approximately a real time of 350ms,
230ms and 220ms immediately after drop cache and service restart, and
150ms, 60ms and 60ms after a prefetch (hand-wavy average over 3 runs, I
didn't have the patience to do proper testing).
(In both cases, user/sys are less than 10ms; I don't see much difference
there)

If I restart the service without dropping caches and redo the query I
get 60ms from the first query onwards so I must not be preloading
everything properly, some real script that would look all over a
container to properly restore the page cache would do better than me
blindly preloading a few files.

Either way, we're talking about a factor of 2-3 until the application has
been looking at most of the entries, and I didn't try to see how that
would look like on spinning disks or the kind of slow storage one would
get on VPS somewhere in the cloud - I'm sure someone with time to waste
could get much more impressive figures, but this already look pretty
worthwhile to me.
