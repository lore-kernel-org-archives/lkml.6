Are you sure?  On my laptop, /dev/kvm is 0666, and that's the distro
default.  I don't think this is at all unusual.  I'm not particularly
concerned about a guest attacking itself, but it's conceptually
straightforward to bypass whatever restrictions the host has by simply
opening /dev/kvm and sticking your enclave in a VM.

I'm not singling out SGX.  I'm just saying that the KVM should not
magically bypass host policy.  If you want to assign a virtual
function on your NIC to a KVM guest, you need to give your QEMU
process that privilege.  Similarly, if someone has a MAC policy that
controls which processes can launch which enclaves and they want to
run Windows with full SGX support in a VM guest, then they should
authorize that in their MAC policy by giving QEMU unrestricted launch
privileges.

Similarly, if access to a persistent provisioning identifier is
restricted, access to /dev/kvm shouldn't magically bypass it.  Just
give the QEMU process the relevant privileges.
