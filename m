I've found https://codesearch.debian.net/ useful for digging into this
kind of question, though it tends to throw up a lot of false positives.

Most uses I've seen do nothing more than use the FPE_xyz value to
format diagnostic messages while dying.  I struggled to find code that
made a meaningful functional decision based on the value, though that's
not proof...
