[original patch author from 2012 chiming in here]

When doing a test on Windows, I guess it's vital to use a generic VGA / VESA 
driver. The Intel GPU driver will modify the interrupt configuration 
registers. Also at least I don't know if Windows has similar logic like Linux 
to disable spurious interrupts after XX unhandled interrupts.
Personally I'm unsure if the Windows test is worth the time.

Back in 2012 I tried to report this as a video BIOS bug via the Intel Open 
Source Technology Center. There was not much interest to report an issue to 
the BIOS developers. I have private emails from other people with similar 
problems on "Kenosha Pass" based boards. One of them talked to an actual Intel 
BIOS engineer in 2014, but still that didn't get anything fixed.

Regarding a generic fix: The problem is testing on real hardware.
Some Intel GPUs have different configuration registers. The Intel GPU driver 
could be used as template, but doing a fix without actual hardware to verify 
it is unsafe (=might mess up the system in unexpected ways).
