Hmm, if the last thread is do_exit(), by definition there can't be any
other VCPU thread (because then it wouldn't be the last one) and
therefore only this last exiting thread can have the fd open, and since
it's in the middle of do_exit(), it will close the fds before anything
will have chance to run.

Then I think this commit text is misleading and pretty confusing.  If
we have a correct implementation, but we want to clean something up,
then this commit message shouldn't talk about races or use-after-free,
it should just say that we rearrange code to change the flow, and
describe why/how.

Hmm, I'm not really sure it is a cleanup.  In any case, the motivation
for this change should be clear.  I do like the idea of getting read of
the kvm->arch.pgd checks in the various stage2 manipulation functions.

Ah, then I think it should say

"We can set kvm->arch.pgd = NULL without holding a spinlock because this
function is only called when the exiting thread is the only process
holding a refernce to the struct kvm."
