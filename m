I feel you should remove this "buried" thing at least from the plain
instructions - first of all, I'm not convinced it actually *works* in
general (network managers are able to find it anyway, right? perhaps
android's has some rules?), and it's not really necessary from a kernel
POV.

Perhaps add a note like "you may have to rename or otherwise hide the
eth0 from your connection manager" (also "NetworkManager" is a specific
software, so "network manager" is confusing - I actually first thought
you meant NM).

Anyway, just a thought.

Thanks!

Fair enough. I still think it'd be worthwhile in the long run because
then you could start multiple APs to simulate roaming etc. without
having to implement all of this here.

IOW - I don't think we should extend this much. As is, I think it's
fine, but I wouldn't want to see extensions like "have two scan result",
"let userspace control the RSSI of the scan results to force 'roaming'"
etc.

That doesn't seem right - a 2 GHz channel that's really 5.5 GHz?

That seems more like a copy/paste bug rather than intentional?

That's ... strangely formatted? I guess we'd usually write

	{ .bitrate = 10 },
	{ .bitrate = 20 },
	...

Please use ARRAY_SIZE()

That looks _really_ bare - you may want to copy something sane to here.

same here - max_power 5500?

Same comment here regarding formatting.

Maybe make that __ro_after_init?

It doesn't matter that much, but is a good signal.

Seems like you could make that const?
	struct {
		u8 tag;
		u8 len;
		u8 ssid[8];
	} ssid = { .tag = 0, .len = 8, .ssid = "VirtWifi" };

or something like that?

Hmm, maybe that doesn't work.. whatever, not really important.

Hmm, what's the point of doing it twice? You don't really need to
receive both PRESP/BEACON, just one is sufficient.

I don't think you need to make that async again.

If you wanted to be more "real", you'd accept this and then check it in
the connect worker, rejecting it there if mismatched.

You should check that mac is fake_router_bssid, and otherwise return not
found (-ENOENT), IIRC.

I think you should just drop the frame.

FWIW, the stuff beyond this point, especially the netlink, I'm less
familiar with.
