"make check", or "make -k check" if you're concerned about some tests 
failing to build (e.g. the compiler running out of memory on a few large 
tests) - the testsuite should continue after execution failures, but not 
after compilation failures.  (Having previously configured with 
--prefix=/usr for the build.  And if the compiler used doesn't have 
libgcc_s and libstdc++ shared libraries in directories ld.so searches by 
default, you should copy those libraries into the glibc build directory 
before running tests.)  On a system that can handle it you'd use an 
appropriate -jN option for parallelism, but probably not on m68k.

For cross testing over SSH (when glibc is running on a system that is very 
slow running the compiler or has too little memory to do so) you need a 
shared filesystem at the same path on both the system where glibc is built 
and the system where tests will execute (probably NFS-exported from the 
build system, and it may be necessary to mount it on the test system with 
acdirmax=0,acdirmin=0 to limit any caching).  Then you can pass 
test-wrapper="/path/to/glibc/scripts/cross-test-ssh.sh <host>" to make 
check.

In both cases, for very slow test systems you may wish to export 
TIMEOUTFACTOR (an integer by which all test timeouts are multiplied).
