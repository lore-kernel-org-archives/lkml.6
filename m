Path of activation via both devices is same. Both will call
proc_thermal_add().

There is no INT3401 on any newer atom or core platforms, so you can't
enumerate on this device. We don't control what ACPI device is present
on a system. It depends on what the other non-Linux OS is using.
 Also the PCI  ACPI companion device doesn't have to supply a _TMP
method.


The INT3401 is a special device which must have _TMP otherwise firmware
validation will fail. Yes, if there is INT3401 on all platforms we
don't need PCI enumeration just for temperature and trips. But this PCI
device brings in lots of other features which are still in works.


Not sure about the context of discussion here. Are you suggesting some
core changes where we don't have to add PCI ids like Skylake etc. ?
