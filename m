In this case, for the pci_dev for the rootport:
- rootport_total_fatal_errors will be incremented (since it will get ERR_FATAL)
- dev_total_fatal_errors will not be incremented.

The dev_total_fatal_errors will be incremented only for the pci device
identified by the "Error Source Identification Register" in the PCIe
spec. Does this help clarify?
