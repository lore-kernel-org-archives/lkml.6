I'd be keen to try to document this as a follow-up patch, otherwise there's
the risk of biting off more than I can chew, which is easily done with this
stuff! For arm32 (v7) and arm64, ioremap_wc() returns "normal, non-cacheable
memory". Some notable differences between this and the memory type returned
by ioremap() are:

 * ioremap_wc() allows speculative reads
 * ioremap_wc() allows unaligned access
 * ioremap_wc() allows reordering of accesses to different addresses
 * ioremap_wc() allows merging of accesses

so for us, you really only want to use it to map things that look an awful
lot like memory.

Right, my expectation is actually that you very rarely need ordering
guarantees for wc mappings, and so saying "relaxed + mandatory barriers"
is the best thing to say for portable driver code. I'm deliberately /not/
trying to enumerate arch or device-specific behaviours.

I can add something along these lines, since this seems like it could be a
bit of a "gotcha" given the macro names and implicit x86 heritage.

At least on arm and arm64, the heavy barrier in outX() is *before* the I/O
access, and so it does nothing to prevent the access from being posted. It
looks like the asm-generic/io.h behaviour is the same in the case that none
of the __io_* barriers are provided by the architecture.

Do you think this is something we actually need to strengthen, or are
drivers that rely on this going to be x86-specific anyway?

Sure, hence my disclaimer at the beginning about non-portable drivers :)
My goal here is really to document the portable semantics for the common
architectures, so that driver developers and reviewers can get the usual
case right.
