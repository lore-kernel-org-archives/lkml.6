Ok, this seems fine so far. So the vop-host-backend is a regular PCI
driver that implements the VOP protocol from the host side, and it
can talk to either a MIC, or another guest-backend written for the PCI-EP
framework to implement the same protocol, right?

Ah, so the direction is fixed, and it's the opposite of what Christoph
and I were expecting. This is probably something we need to discuss
a bit. From what I understand, there is no technical requirement why
it has to be this direction, right?

What I mean is that the same vop framework could work with
a PCI-EP driver implementing the vop-host-backend and
a PCI driver implementing the vop-guest-backend? In order
to do this, the PCI-EP configuration would need to pick whether
it wants the EP to be the vop host or guest, but having more
flexibility in it (letting each side add virtio devices) would be
harder to do.

This is a part I don't understand yet. Does this mean that the
normal operation is between a user space process on the vop-host
talking to the kernel on the vop-guest?

I'm a bit worried about the ioctl interface here, as this combines the
configuration side with the actual data transfer, and that seems
a bit inflexible.

Ok.

Ok, so you can have multiple virtio devices (e.g. a virtio-net and
virtio-console) but not an arbitrary number? I suppose we can always
extend it later if that becomes a problem.
