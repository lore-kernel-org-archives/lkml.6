Your original patch avoids this problem by setting PCI_DEV_FLAGS_NO_D3
on the root port, so it seems like this must be somehow related to the
root port's state.

I assume this VPD read is on the i40 device, right?  Since you're
still seeing the problem even after calling
pci_config_pm_runtime_get(), I assume the root port is still not in
D0.  Can you add a little more instrumentation to read PCI_PM_CTRL and
PCI_PM_PPB_EXTENSIONS for the root port and PCI_PM_CTRL for the i40
device right after you call pci_config_pm_runtime_get()?

I don't see anything obviously different between the pci_read_config()
path and the pci_vpd_read() path except for the
pci_config_pm_runtime_get() call that you've already added.  I guess
you could try using setpci instead of lspci to see if the failure only
happens in the pci_vpd_read() path.  I assume that will be the case
because lspci probably does config reads before it does the VPD read,
and those initial config reads seemed to work OK.

The VPD path does do config writes in addition to config reads.  Maybe
there's something special about writes, although I don't know what
that would be.  You can tell I'm running out of ideas here :)
