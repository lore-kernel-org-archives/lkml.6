Indeed, I don't consider this attempt not very practical in general,
especially as it would rely on KSM right now, which is frowned upon by
many people.

So, it takes some time from when the guest boots up until the balloon
device was initialized and therefore page hinting can start. For that
period, you won't get any arch_free_page()/page hinting callbacks, correct.

However in the hypervisor, you can theoretically track which pages the
guest actually touched ("dirty"), so you already know "which pages were
never touched while booting up until virtio-balloon was brought to
life". These, you can directly exclude from migration. No interface
required.

The remaining problem is pages that were touched ("allocated") by the
guest during bootup but freed again, before virtio-balloon came up. One
would have to measure how many pages these usually are, I would say it
would not be that many (because recently freed pages are likely to be
used again next for allocation). However, there are some pages not being
reported.

During the lifetime of the guest, this should not be a problem,
eventually one of these pages would get allocated/freed again, so the
problem "solves itself over time". You are looking into the special case
of migrating the VM just after it has been started. But we have the
exact same problem also for ordinary free page hinting, so we should
rather solve that problem. It is not migration specific.

If we are looking for an alternative to "problem solves itself",
something like "if virtio-balloon comes up, it will report all free
pages step by step using free page hinting, just like we would have from
"arch_free_pages()"". This would be the same interface we are using for
free page hinting - and it could even be made configurable in the guest.

The current approach we are discussing internally for details about
Nitesh's work ("how the magic inside arch_fee_pages() will work
efficiently) would allow this as far as I can see just fine.

There would be a tiny little window between virtio-balloon comes up and
it has reported all free pages step by step, but that can be considered
a very special corner case that I would argue is not worth it to be
optimized.

If I am missing something important here, sorry in advance :)
