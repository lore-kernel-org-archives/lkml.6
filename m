I see what you mean looking at the different ideal_nops based on configurations.

I don't think that's necessary. In proposed implementation of PIE,
kernel modules would not use a GOT call. In the current implementation
the __fentry__ call is always GOT based (6-bytes). I will simplify the
runtime implementation in the next patch set to just swap the expected
size and ideal_nop when PIE is enabled.
