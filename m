Do you have a PCIe 4.0 spec?  I think 5.0 is about to come out, so
it'd be nice to have at least a 4.0 citation (including section
number), if you have one.

s/of is/is/, I guess?

I'm hoping Lukas will chime in here; thanks for cc'ing him already.

Would you mind updating this reference to the
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci form that doesn't depend on external
organizations?

https://www.kernel.org/lore.html has some details, but unfortunately
lacks a hint about how to construct the URL.  What I do is look up the
Message-ID and use, e.g.,

  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/<Message-ID>

I'm not 100% sure this is worth KERN_WARN unless the user might be
able to do something about it.
