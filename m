I think that in the absence of VMAP_STACK, there will always be cases where we
*could* corrupt a neighbouring stack, but I agree that trying to minimize that
possibility would be good.

Given this is already out-of-line, how about we always use panic(), regardless
of VMAP_STACK and SCHED_STACK_END_CHECK? i.e. just

	if (unlikely(size >= stack_left))
		panic("alloca over the kernel stack boundary");

If we have VMAP_STACK selected, and overflow during the panic, it's the same as
if we overflowed during the BUG(). It's likely that panic() will use less stack
space than BUG(), and the compiler can put the call in a slow path that
shouldn't affect most calls, so in all cases it's likely preferable.

Thanks,
Mark.
