I believe that seeing the end-goal would make reasoning about patches
easier, otherwise the complaint =E2=80=9Cbut anyhow it=E2=80=99s all =
insecure=E2=80=9D keeps popping
up.

I=E2=80=99m not sure CET or other CFI would be enough even with this =
threat-model.
The page-tables (the very least) need to be write-protected, as =
otherwise
controlled data writes may just modify them. There are various possible
solutions I presume: write_rare for page-tables, hypervisor-assisted
security to obtain physical level NX/RO (a-la Microsoft VBS) or some =
sort of
hardware enclave.

What do you think?=
