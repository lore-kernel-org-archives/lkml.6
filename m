Yes it's the kinda of behaviour you would expect on a flush indeed! I
don't know what the card actaully does when turning the cache on,
whether it's actually flush of something persistent when turning the
cache on after a hard poweroff or doing some other validation. 

All i can share is what our testing seems to indicate, which is that
there is a wide spread in the time the card needs *and* there seems to
be strong correlation to the I/O activity before the hard power off and
the time taken by "cache on".

Probably a silly question, but would this actually cause e.g. boot to
hang while waiting for the card (assuming rootfs is somewhere else)?
