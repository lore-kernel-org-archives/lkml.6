That is in the deprecated "v2" part of the sg driver (for around 15 years).
There are lots more interesting races with that interface than that one
described above. My guess is that all system calls would be susceptible
to playing around with a buffer being passed to or from the OS by a thread
other than the one doing the system call, during that call. Surely no Unix
like OS gives any security guarantees to a thread being attacked by a
malevolent thread in the same process!

My question is did this actually cause to program to fail; or is it something
that a sanity checker flagged?

Also wouldn't it be better just to return an error such as EINVAL if
opcode != command[0]  ?
