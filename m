Ok, that thread is also concerned with cleaning up the
wait_for_atomic_* pattern to also do something more idiomatic with
wait_event(). I agree that would be better, but I'm running short of
time to go refactor this aou for 4.17 inclusion, especially as I
expect another couple rounds of review on this more urgent data
corruption fix series that depends on this new api. I think the
addition of wait_for_atomic_one() makes it clear that we need a way to
pass a conditional expression rather than create a variant api for
each different condition. Can you help me out with an attempt of your
own, or at least point in a direction that you would accept for
solving the "Except the current wait_event() doesn't do the whole key
part that makes the hash-table 'work'."  problem that you highlighted?
