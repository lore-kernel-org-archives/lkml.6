That is not _completely_ true. 
Iirc (Please someone do yell at me if I'm wrong!), this is as follows.
You will in fact be dumpable as long as you don't set{g,u}id() to an
effective uid that is different from the effective uid of the process
that created the task. For example, if you clone(CLONE_NEWUSER) as an
unprivileged user with uid and euid 1000 you are in fact dumpable and
thus traceable *but* if you do a setuid(0) in the new task then you will
end up with old->euid = 1000 and new->euid = 0 at which point the kernel
will remove the dumpable flag and the creating process cannot trace you
anymore (which has funny consequences for lsm isolation and sending fds
around). Iiuc, The same logic applies when you do a setns() to another
user namespace.

	/* dumpability changes */
	if (!uid_eq(old->euid, new->euid) ||
	    !gid_eq(old->egid, new->egid) ||
	    !uid_eq(old->fsuid, new->fsuid) ||
	    !gid_eq(old->fsgid, new->fsgid) ||
	    !cred_cap_issubset(old, new)) {
		if (task->mm)
			set_dumpable(task->mm, suid_dumpable); <<< suid_dumpable == 0 at this point
		task->pdeath_signal = 0;
		smp_wmb();
	}
