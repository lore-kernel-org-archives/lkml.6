Typo: that's "system s/power/perf/ default", i.e. uclamp_default_perf
introduced by this patch.

This composition is done in uclamp_effective_get() but it's
slightly different, since we want to support a "nice policy" where
tasks can always ask less then what they have got assigned.

Thus, from an abstract standpoint, if a task is in a cgroup:

     task.min <= R_g.min
     task.max <= R_g.max

While, for tasks in the root cgroup system default applies and we
enforece:

     task.min >= R_0.min
     task.max <= R_0.max

... where the "nice policy" is currently not more supported, but
perhaps we can/should use the same for system defaults too.

Right.

We change only the "requested" value, not the "effective" one.

Right, that's what we do for the "effective" value.

Yes, although the complexity is mostly in the composition logic
described above not on mapping at all. We have "mapping" overheads
only when we change a "request" value and that's from slow-paths.

The "effective" value is computed at each enqueue time by composing
precomputed bucket_id representing the current "requested" task's,
cgroup's and system default's values.

Yes.

This mean will lazy update the "requested" bucket_id by deferring its
computation at enqueue time. Which saves us a copy of the bucket_id,
i.e. we will have only the "effective" value updated at enqueue time.

But...

> Would that not be simpler?

... although being simpler it does not fully exploit the slow-path,
a syscall which is usually running from a different process context
(system management software).

It also fits better for lazy updates but, in the cgroup case, where we
wanna enforce an update ASAP for RUNNABLE tasks, we will still have to
do the updates from the slow-path.

Will look better into this simplification while working on v7, perhaps
the linear mapping can really help in that too.
