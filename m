RCU and sys_membarrier are more similar than you might think at first.  
For one thing, if there were primitives for blocking and unblocking
reception of IPIs, those primitives would delimit critical sections for
sys_membarrier.  (Maybe such things do exist; I wouldn't know.)

For another, the way we model RCU isn't fully accurate for the Linux
kernel, as you know.  Since individual instructions cannot be
preempted, each instruction is a tiny read-side critical section.
Thus, litmus tests like this one:

	P0			P1
	Wa=1			Wb=1
	synchronize_rcu()	Ra=0
	Rb=0

actually are forbidden in the kernel (provided P1 isn't part of the
idle loop!), even though the LKMM allows them.  However, it wouldn't
be forbidden if the accesses in P1 were swapped -- just like with
sys_membarrier.

Put these two observations together and you see that sys_membarrier is
almost exactly the same as RCU without explicit read-side critical
sections. Perhaps this isn't surprising, given that the initial
implementation of sys_membarrier() was pretty much the same as
synchronize_rcu().

In all the examples I'm aware of, no more than one of the IPIs
generated by each sys_membarrier call really matters.  (Of course,
there's no way to know in advance which one it will be, so you have to
send an IPI to every CPU.)  The execution delays and reordering
between different CPUs' IPIs don't appear to be significant.

I regard the fixed-time approach as nothing more than a heuristic
aid.  It's not an accurate explaination of what's really going on.
