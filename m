AFAIK PCI firmware bindings should go into PCI firmware specifications,
not Microsoft webpages.

If we deviate from this model there is no way to tell whether that extra
information is right or wrong, it is not necessarily about this patch,
it is about changing the way these bindings are deployed in future
systems.

I think that the way these bindings were deployed is wrong, I agree this
is not the right forum to discuss that though. What you will do with
this patch is not my call anyway, I just expressed my opinion.
