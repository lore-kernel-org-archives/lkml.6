I think the commit is the following one and it does say so. But what is
the rationale of tagging only PTE page as PageTable and updating the zone
stat but not doing so for higher level page table pages ? Are not they
used as page table pages ? Should not they count towards NR_PAGETABLE ?

pgtable_page_ctor/dtor() use across arch is not consistent and there is a need
for generalization which has been already acknowledged earlier. But for now we
can atleast fix this on arm64.

Why would it be considered wrong ? IIUC archs have their own understanding
of this and there are different implementations. But doing something for
PTE page and skipping for others is plain inconsistent.

The only extra thing to be done for THP is initializing page->pmd_huge_pte
apart from calling pgtable_page_ctor(). Right not it just works on arm64
may be because page->pmd_huge_pte never gets accessed before it's init and
no path checks for it when not THP. Its better to init/reset pmd_huge_pte.
