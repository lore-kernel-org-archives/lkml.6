Subject: [PATCH 1/2] PCI: Prevent 64-bit resources from being counted in 32-bit bridge region
X-SA-Exim-Version: 4.2.1 (built Tue, 02 Aug 2016 21:08:31 +0000)

When using the pci=realloc command line argument, with hpmemsize not
equal to zero, some hierarchies of 32-bit resources can fail to be
assigned in some situations. When this happens, the user will see
some PCI BAR resources being ignored and some PCI Bridge windows
being left unset. In lspci this may look like:

  Memory behind bridge: fff00000-000fffff

or

  Region 0: Memory at <ignored> (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=256K]

Ignored BARs mean the underlying device will not be usable.

The possible situations where this can happen will be quite varied and
depend highly on the exact hierarchy and how the realloc code ends up
trying to assign the regions. It's known to at least require a
large 64-bit BAR (>1GB) below a PCI bridge.

The cause of this bug is in __pci_bus_size_bridges() which tries to
calculate the total resource space required for each of the bridge windows
(typically IO, 64-bit, and 32-bit / non-prefetchable). The code, as
written, tries to allocate all the 64-bit prefetchable resources
followed by all the remaining resources. It uses two calls to
pbus_size_mem() for this. If the first call to pbus_size_mem() fails
it tries to fit all resources into the 32-bit bridge window and it
expects the size of the 32-bit bridge window to be multiple GBs which
will never be assignable under the 4GB limit imposed on it.

There are only two reasons for pbus_size_mem() to fail: if there is no
64-bit/prefetchable bridge window, or if that window is already
assigned (in other words, its resource already has a parent set). We know
the former case can't be true because, in __pci_bus_size_bridges(), it's
existence is checked before making the call. So if the pbus_size_mem()
call in question fails, the window must already be assigned, and in this
case, we still do not want 64-bit resources trying to be sized into the
32-bit catch-all resource.

So to fix the bug, we must always set mask, type2 and type3 in cases
where a 64-bit resource exists even if pbus_size_mem() fails.
