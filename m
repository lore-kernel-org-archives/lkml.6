I've realized only now that this patch fixes fallout of commit
5d32a66541c4 ("PCI/ACPI: Allow ACPI to be built without CONFIG_PCI set")
which is part of Rafael's acpi pull for v4.21.

Usually such fixes go through the same tree as the offending commit,
so I'd expect Raphael to pick up the whole series and forward it to
Linus in the second half of the merge window.  I'm not sure if that's
how it'll play out though given the holidays.

Additionally, drm-misc is currently in a somewhat confusing state:
Normally fixes targeting v4.21 should have been applied to
drm-misc-next-fixes for the last 2 weeks, yet no new commits have
been applied to that branch since December 5, but plenty of stuff
that should have been applied (various fixes and a MAINTAINERS change)
went to drm-misc-next instead.  So it looks like a lot of folks picked
the wrong branch and drm-misc-next is now a mix of v4.22 features and
v4.21 fixes.  I think I should rather not add to this mess before a
drm-misc maintainer has had a chance to sort it out.

I'll be sure to keep an eye on this though.  The fallout addressed by
the patch is mostly confined to randconfigs I think, so waiting a few
more days probably won't hurt much.

Thanks,

Lukas
