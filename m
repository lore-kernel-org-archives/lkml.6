Userspace has to already know, since otherwise things don't work today,
so I think we can omit this.

We should probably think about that.  Perhaps it could be tied to the
return value of KVM_CAP_ARM_CONFIG_PHYS_SHIFT ?

It's a bit stranded.  Drew was driving this work (on cc).  But the ID
register exposed to the guest should represent the actual limits
of the VM, so I don't think we need userspace to configure this, but we
can implement this in KVM based on the PA range configured for the VM.
