Huh? I'm lost. If you have a bunch of PCI devices you can send them as a
list to this API, if you want. If the driver is _sure_ they are all the
same, you only have to send one. In your terminology, you'd just have to
call the interface with:

pci_p2pdma_distance(target, [initiator, target])

> Why can't we model that as two separate transactions?

You could, but this is more convenient for users of the API that need to
deal with multiple devices (and manage devices that may be added or
removed at any time).

The way it's implemented is more general and can handle all use cases.
You are arguing for a function that can handle your case (albeit with a
bit more fuss) but can't handle mine and is therefore less general.
Calling my interface specialized is wrong.
