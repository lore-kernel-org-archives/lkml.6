Given physical CPU hotplug isn't common, this way will make only irq 39
and irq 40 active most of times, so performance regression is caused just
as Kashyap reported.

I think this way is still better, since performance regression can be
avoided, and there is at least one CPU for covering one irq vector,
in reality, it is often enough.

As I mentioned in another email, I still don't understand why interrupts
can't be delivered to CPU 4~7 after these CPUs become present & online.
Seems in theory, interrupts should be delivered to these CPUs since
affinity info has been programmed to interrupt controller already. 

Or do we still need CPU hotplug handler for device driver to tell device
the CPU hotplug change for delivering interrupts to new added CPUs?


Thanks,
