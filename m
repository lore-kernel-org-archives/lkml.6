Userspace would obviously need to be aware of the fixup behavior, but
it actually works out fairly nicely to have a separate path for ERESUME
fixup since a fault on EENTER is generally fatal, whereas as a fault on
ERESUME might be recoverable.


do_eenter:
    mov     tcs, %rbx
    lea     async_exit, %rcx 
    mov     $EENTER, %rax
    ENCLU

/*
 * EEXIT or EENTER faulted.  In the latter case, %RAX already holds some
 * fault indicator, e.g. -EFAULT.
 */
eexit_or_eenter_fault:
    ret

async_exit:
    ENCLU

fixup_handler:
    <do fault stuff>

Wouldn't that blast away any stack changes made by the enclave?
