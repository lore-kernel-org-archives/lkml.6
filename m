Says the expert who knows exactly how it's all put together. It took
me a couple of hours just to understand WTF the syzbot reproducer
was actually doing....

I don't care how syzbot generates the filesystem image it uses.

It doesn't matter *what subsystem breaks*. If syzbot is generating a
filesystem image and then mounting it, it needs to provide that
filesystem image to to people who end up having to debug the
problem. It's a basic "corrupt filesystem" bug triage step.

And that's clearly the case here, whether you like it or not.

You want us to do things that make syzbot more useful as a tool but
you don't want to do things that make syzbot a useful tool for us.
It's a two way street....

Cheers,

Dave.
