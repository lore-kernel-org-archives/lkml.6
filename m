Thanks for sharing some additional technical context on this, very
useful.

I have another question though: shouldn't those ISA devices be child
devices of the PCI controller, if they use some resources of the PCI
controller ? Could you give an example of such an ISA device driver ?
This is just to understand better the issue, because there seems to be
a kind of hidden dependency between those ISA drivers and the setup of
the PCI controller.

OK. There's today a single platform (Footbridge) that uses
pci_map_io_early(), and it is indeed called through the ->map_io()
hook, which is very early in the boot process.

BTW, look at drivers/pcmcia/at91_cf.c. It has ->probe() and ->remove(),
and does a pci_ioremap_io() in its ->probe(), and nothing in its
->remove(). I don't think this driver, compiled as a module, will work
well after a insmod/rmmod/insmod cycle.

Absolutely. Glad to hear that you agree on the longer term plan.

Totally true.

Well, I can revert:

42342073e38b50113354944cd51dcfed28d857a1 PCI: mvebu: Convert to use
pci_host_bridge directly ee1604381a371b3ea6aec7d5e43b6e3f5e153854 PCI:
mvebu: Only remap I/O space if configured

so it's not a big deal either. I can revert those, and then resubmit a
more complete series later on that moves pci-mvebu to use
pci_remap_iospace().

Bjorn, Lorenzo, what do you prefer ? 

If we want to get rid of pci_ioremap_io(), then we need a way to tell
pci_remap_iospace() the memory attributes that should be used for the
mapping, because on Armada 38x, we need to map the I/O space mapped
MT_UNCACHED instead of MT_DEVICE. I'm not sure how to achieve this yet.
Should pgprot_device() be changed to return MT_UNCACHED on a
platform-specific basis ? Any other idea ?

Best regards,

Thomas
