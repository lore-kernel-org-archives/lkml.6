Yes but now you use FREQUENCY_UTIL for computing 'max_util' in the EAS
prediction.

Let's take an example. You have a perf domain with two CPUs. One CPU is
busy running a RT task, the other CPU runs a CFS task. Right now in
compute_energy() we only use ENERGY_UTIL, so 'max_util' ends up being
the max between the utilization of the two tasks. So we don't predict
we're going to max freq.

With your patch, we use FREQUENCY_UTIL to compute 'max_util', so we
_will_ predict that we're going to max freq. And we will do that even if
CONFIG_UCLAMP_TASK=n.

The default EAS calculation will be different with your patch when there
are runnable RT tasks in the system. This needs to be documented, I
think.

I'm not saying it's useful, I'm saying userspace can decide to do that
if it thinks it is a good idea. The default should be min_cap = 1024 for
RT, no questions. But you _can_ change it at runtime if you want to.
That's my point. And doing that basically provides the same behaviour as
what we have right now in terms of EAS calculation (but it changes the
freq selection obviously) which is why I'm not fundamentally opposed to
your patch.

So in short, I'm fine with the behavioural change, but please at least
mention it somewhere :-)

Thanks,
Quentin
