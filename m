Yes, that's the covert communication channel that can cross container
and machine boundaries without any required privileges.

Which uses exactly the same mechanisms as the first case. i.e.
controlled invalidation and page cache residency monitoring.If we
aren't going to solve the first problem case, the we aren't going to
solve the second because they are one and the same problem...

However, I suspect you have misunderstood the monitoring mechanism
here - dispatch IO for this page doesn't prevent the information
leak about that page. It's when we return EAGAIN that we leak
information about page cache residency.

What Linus is attempting to do is perturb the nearby state of the
page cache by triggering async readahead in the EAGAIN case.  Async
readahead will fill all the holes in readahead window and hence
destroy the information about where the page fault landed and
instantiated the page cache. That would prevent the attacker from
determining what code the executable is running as they would only
be able to check a single page in an executable at a time and that
makes the attack highly impractical.

But if the attacker uses FADV_RANDOM, readahead is only triggered
for the page the attacker is trying to read. Hence it does not
disturb the nearby page cache residency pattern the executable's
page faults left behind and so doesn't destroy the information that
they are trying to extract from the unwilling process.

Sure, Linus's change makes monitoring the executable file after
FADV_RANDOM a "read-once" mechanism. However, detection of what code
is executing is a repeated invalidate-and-sweep exercise to begin
with, so it basically doesn't change the information or the rate at
which the monitoring process can extract information from the file.

/me hasn't thought about this sort of stuff since he was running
page cache invalidation attacks on Irix system libraries way back in
2002 when he found a libc bug that killed the init process and
paniced the kernel.

This isn't my first rodeo - it's been well known for a long, long
time that the system page cache can be exploited to monitor
executing code...

Cheers,

Dave.
