So don't. Xen got grand-fathered in because when that came
along we thought it's a one off thing. Was easier to just
add that as a special case. But really >99% of people
have a hypervisor device with direct guest memory access.
All else is esoterica.

Legacy setups by definition are working setups.  The rules are pretty
simple. By default virtio == full guest memory access.
If your access is limited or translated in any way, you use a device
with ACCESS_PLATFORM. When in doubt use ACCESS_PLATFORM.

Xen was there before, and it does not have a flag and it still
wants ACCESS_PLATFORM semantics without setting ACCESS_PLATFORM
sometimes. So we don't want to break existing setups,
and we make an exception in that case.
I don't really see any good reason to make more exceptions.

Nor IMHO should we trust all platform people to know about virtio
and have special kind of DMA API just for virtio.
