Well in that case we should just stick with -1 value for the
autosuspend. And just do pm_runtime_put_sync_suspend() after
probe and on close.

Agreed. And that is the case already.

In this case it seems that the only thing needed is to just
configure the autosuspend delay for the parent port. The use of
-1 has been around since the start of runtime PM AFAIK, so maybe
we should just document it. I guess we could also introduce
pm_runtime_block_autoidle_unless_configured() :)

So if your serdev controller was to set the parent autosuspend
delay on open() and set it back on close() this should work?
