In fact, it's not just trying to avoid confusing users. Kexec loading
and kexec_file loading are just do the same thing in essence. Just we
need do kernel image verification on uefi system, have to port kexec
loading code to kernel. 

Kexec has been a formal feature in our distro, and customers owning
those kind of very large machine can make use of this feature to speed
up the reboot process. On uefi machine, the kexec_file loading will
search place to put kernel under 4G from top to down. As we know, the
1st 4G space is DMA32 ZONE, dma, pci mmcfg, bios etc all try to consume
it. It may have possibility to not be able to find a usable space for
kernel/initrd. From the top down of the whole memory space, we don't
have this worry. 

And at the first post, I just posted below with AKASHI's
walk_system_ram_res_rev() version. Later you suggested to use
list_head to link child sibling of resource, see what the code change
looks like.
http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20180322033722.9279-1-bhe@redhat.com

Then I posted v2
http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20180408024724.16812-1-bhe@redhat.com
Rob Herring mentioned that other components which has this tree struct
have planned to do the same thing, replacing the singly linked list with
list_head to link resource child sibling. Just quote Rob's words as
below. I think this could be another reason.

~~~~~ From Rob
The DT struct device_node also has the same tree structure with
parent, child, sibling pointers and converting to list_head had been
on the todo list for a while. ACPI also has some tree walking
functions (drivers/acpi/acpica/pstree.c). Perhaps there should be a
common tree struct and helpers defined either on top of list_head or a
~~~~~
new struct if that saves some size.

Kexec was invented for kernel developer to speed up their kernel
rebooting. Now high end sever admin, kernel developer and QE are also
keen to use it to reboot large box for faster feature testing, bug
debugging. Kernel dev could know this well, about kernel loading
position, admin or QE might not be aware of it very well.

Understood. The list_head replacing patch truly involes too many code
changes, it's risky. I am willing to try any idea from reviewers, won't
persuit they have to be accepted finally. If don't have a try, we don't
know what it looks like, and what impact it may have. I am fine to take
AKASHI's simple version of walk_system_ram_res_rev() to lower risk, even
though it could be a little bit low efficient.

Thanks
Baoquan
