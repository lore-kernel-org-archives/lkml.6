Ok, but then that's a userspace problem, not your driver's problem.
Serial ports can't handle multiple requests in a sane way either, and so
it's a userspace bug if they do that.  It's not up to the kernel to try
to prevent it, and really, you are not preventing this from happening at
all, you are only keeping more than one open() call from happening.  You
aren't serializing the device access at all.

So you are giving yourself a false sense of "We are protecting the
device" here.  Just drop the whole "only one open() call" logic
entirely.  It will make your kernel code simpler and you aren't giving
yourself false-hope that you really prevented userspace from doing
something stupid :)

Go to the nearest whiteboard and write this at the top:
	ALL INPUT IS EVIL

Don't erase it.  You have to validate all the things, otherwise
something bad will happen, I guarantee it.  Wait until the syzbot gets
ahold of this layer if you don't believe me :)

No, what's wrong with a simple:
	mutex_lock();
?

You are only holding it for a very short time, people can wait, there is
no rush here or "fast path" happening.

Anyway, this whole lock should just go away entirely, due to the lack of
needing to track open() calls.  But in the future, keep locks simple, no
need to add complexity when it is not warranted.

See my previous comments for why your attempt at protecting open() does
not prevent this from happening.  Hint, you forgot about dup(3) :(
