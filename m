I think that will work too. We currently don't have a flag to make a
file visible on first-level children only, but it shouldn't be hard to
make one.

Putting CPUs into an isolated child cpuset means removing it from the
root's effective CPUs. So I would probably like to expose the read-only
cpus.effective in the root cgroup so that we can check changes in the
effective cpu list.

I will renew the patchset will your suggestion.

Thanks,
