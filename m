Thanks Jan for the clarification on the patch. I agree with your comments.

From that discussion, I think the problem that it is discussing is w.r.t
journal thread waiting for on-going active transaction updates to be done
and thus causing commit latencies. And I think the proposal is to do not
hold any handle while extents are being mapped in ext4_map_blocks() but
defer it till IO is completely done.

And with the new proposal since the inode will be added to
transaction->t_inode_list only after the IO is completed, there will be
no longer the need to do journal_finish_inode_data_buffers() in the journal
context and thus this problem also will not be observed? Is my understanding
correct, please clarify.
