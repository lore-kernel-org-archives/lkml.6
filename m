Hi,

This eight series is a major revamp of the Landlock design compared to
the previous series [1]. This enables more flexibility and granularity
of access control with file paths. It is now possible to enforce an
access control according to a file hierarchy. Landlock uses the concept
of inode and path to identify such hierarchy. In a way, it brings tools
to program what is a file hierarchy.

There is now three types of Landlock hooks: FS_WALK, FS_PICK and FS_GET.
Each of them accepts a dedicated eBPF program, called a Landlock
program.  They can be chained to enforce a full access control according
to a list of directories or files. The set of actions on a file is well
defined (e.g. read, write, ioctl, append, lock, mount...) taking
inspiration from the major Linux LSMs and some other access-controls
like Capsicum.  These program types are designed to be cache-friendly,
which give room for optimizations in the future.

The documentation patch contains some kernel documentation and
explanations on how to use Landlock.  The compiled documentation and
a talk I gave at FOSDEM can be found here: https://landlock.io
This patch series can be found in the branch landlock-v8 in this repo:
https://github.com/landlock-lsm/linux

There is still some minor issues with this patch series but it should
demonstrate how powerful this design may be. One of these issues is that
it is not a stackable LSM anymore, but the infrastructure management of
security blobs should allow to stack it with other LSM [4].

This is the first step of the roadmap discussed at LPC [2].  While the
intended final goal is to allow unprivileged users to use Landlock, this
series allows only a process with global CAP_SYS_ADMIN to load and
enforce a rule.  This may help to get feedback and avoid unexpected
behaviors.

This series can be applied on top of bpf-next, commit 7d72637eb39f
("Merge branch 'x86-jit'").  This can be tested with
CONFIG_SECCOMP_FILTER and CONFIG_SECURITY_LANDLOCK.  I would really
appreciate constructive comments on the design and the code.


# Landlock LSM

The goal of this new Linux Security Module (LSM) called Landlock is to
allow any process, including unprivileged ones, to create powerful
security sandboxes comparable to XNU Sandbox or OpenBSD Pledge. This
kind of sandbox is expected to help mitigate the security impact of bugs
or unexpected/malicious behaviors in user-space applications.

The approach taken is to add the minimum amount of code while still
allowing the user-space application to create quite complex access
rules.  A dedicated security policy language such as the one used by
SELinux, AppArmor and other major LSMs involves a lot of code and is
usually permitted to only a trusted user (i.e. root).  On the contrary,
eBPF programs already exist and are designed to be safely loaded by
unprivileged user-space.

This design does not seem too intrusive but is flexible enough to allow
a powerful sandbox mechanism accessible by any process on Linux. The use
of seccomp and Landlock is more suitable with the help of a user-space
library (e.g.  libseccomp) that could help to specify a high-level
language to express a security policy instead of raw eBPF programs.
Moreover, thanks to the LLVM front-end, it is quite easy to write an
eBPF program with a subset of the C language.


# Frequently asked questions

## Why is seccomp-bpf not enough?

A seccomp filter can access only raw syscall arguments (i.e. the
register values) which means that it is not possible to filter according
to the value pointed to by an argument, such as a file pathname. As an
embryonic Landlock version demonstrated, filtering at the syscall level
is complicated (e.g. need to take care of race conditions). This is
mainly because the access control checkpoints of the kernel are not at
this high-level but more underneath, at the LSM-hook level. The LSM
hooks are designed to handle this kind of checks.  Landlock abstracts
this approach to leverage the ability of unprivileged users to limit
themselves.

Cf. section "What it isn't?" in Documentation/prctl/seccomp_filter.txt


## Why use the seccomp(2) syscall?

Landlock use the same semantic as seccomp to apply access rule
restrictions. It add a new layer of security for the current process
which is inherited by its children. It makes sense to use an unique
access-restricting syscall (that should be allowed by seccomp filters)
which can only drop privileges. Moreover, a Landlock rule could come
from outside a process (e.g.  passed through a UNIX socket). It is then
useful to differentiate the creation/load of Landlock eBPF programs via
bpf(2), from rule enforcement via seccomp(2).


## Why a new LSM? Are SELinux, AppArmor, Smack and Tomoyo not good
   enough?

The current access control LSMs are fine for their purpose which is to
give the *root* the ability to enforce a security policy for the
*system*. What is missing is a way to enforce a security policy for any
application by its developer and *unprivileged user* as seccomp can do
for raw syscall filtering.

Differences from other (access control) LSMs:
* not only dedicated to administrators (i.e. no_new_priv);
* limited kernel attack surface (e.g. policy parsing);
* constrained policy rules (no DoS: deterministic execution time);
* do not leak more information than the loader process can legitimately
  have access to (minimize metadata inference).
