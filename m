Oops sorry, I misread the voltage above as the startup-delay-us
value :)

Hmm yeah I've been wondering about that. Why not follow the SDIO
standard here though? Do you have links to documentation explaining
that?

I think we can have both if performance is the reason for the
out of band interrupt. We could still use SDIO dat line interrupt
during idle for wake-up events.
