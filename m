We generally try to avoid changing the device tree from inside Linux,
it's meant to describe the hardware as we're given it, not the state of
Linux drivers etc. Perhaps this is an exceptional case but it still
seems fishy.

I also worry that marking the device node disabled might break something
else, but that's maybe me being paranoid.

I guess I don't really understand how things are supposed to work
though. We have the 8250 driver and also the OF platform driver, the
former has already setup the device and then the OF driver just comes
along and takes over?

eg. in the boot log from the mpc8544ds you see:

  serial8250.0: ttyS0 at MMIO 0xe0004500 (irq = 42, base_baud = 115200) is a 16550A
  printk: console [ttyS0] enabled
  printk: console [ttyS0] enabled
  printk: bootconsole [udbg0] disabled
  printk: bootconsole [udbg0] disabled
  of_serial: probe of e0004500.serial failed with error -22

ie. the 8250 core has already setup the device, so there should really
be nothing to do?

If the 8250 code could detect that it already has this port registered
then maybe things would work.

The patch below works for me with mpc8544ds. Whether it's worth changing
the 8250 code this much to accomodate legacy_serial I'm not sure.

cheers
