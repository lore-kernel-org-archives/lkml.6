The lspci output you attached
(https://bugzilla.kernel.org/attachment.cgi?id=276771) shows this:

  01:00.0 3D controller: NVIDIA Corporation GK107M [GeForce GT 745M] (rev ff) (prog-if ff)
	!!! Unknown header type 7f

I think that means the config reads are returning ~0 data (0xff),
probably because the device is powered off and the config reads don't
work.

But I don't understand that because both proc_bus_pci_read() (for
reads vis /proc) and pci_read_config() (for reads via /sys) call
pci_config_pm_runtime_get(), and I thought that would wake up the
device so we could read config space.

Is it the intended behavior that lspci will show this sort of invalid
data sometimes?  It's pretty confusing to users.  Or is there
something wrong with the pci_config_pm_runtime_get() path in those
config accessors?
