Marc, Dave,

I like Dave's approach. Some comments below.

We also need to advertise which attributes are supported by the host,
so that the user can tune the available ones. That would make a bit mask
like the above trickier, unless we return the supported values back
in the argument ptr for the "probe" call. And this scheme in general
can be useful for passing back a non-boolean result specific to the
attribute, without having a per-attribute ioctl. (e.g, maximum limit
for IPA).

nit: Could we simply do s/kvm_create_vm_attr/kvm_vm_attr/ everywhere ?
While I agree that the kvm_create_vm_attr makes it implicit that the attributes
are valid only "create" ioctl, the lack of an ioctl to set the VM attribute
should be sufficient to indicate the same.

True. I could hack something up along the lines above and send it here.
