Personally I think this is great stuff.  I too have never wanted to
touch Kconfig stuff due to the complexity, and having unit tests like
this is a great idea to help ensure that things do not break.

Your first 5 patches should be queued up for the next merge window, no
problem (see my comments on the 6th).  As for the rest, I don't have any
objection to them, and using python3 over python2 is a good idea.  And
anyone who wants to do Kconfig work can easily install the needed
packages, it's not required by any "normal" kernel developer.

Anyway, nice job, it's great to see this happening, no objection from me
at all!
