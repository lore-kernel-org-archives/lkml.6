Wild brainstorming ahead...

Such non-string character arrays are usually fixed-size, right? We
could use struct types around such character arrays to hide the actual
characters (so that people don't accidentally use them with C string
APIs), and enforce that the length is passed around as part of the
type... something like:

#define char_array(len) struct { char __ca_data[len]; }
#define __CA_UNWRAP(captr) (captr)->__ca_data, sizeof((captr)->__ca_data)

void __str2ca(char *dst, size_t dst_len, char *src) {
  size_t src_len = strlen(src);
  if (WARN_ON(src_len > dst_len)) {
    // or whatever else we think is the safest way to deal with this
    // without crashing, if BUG() is not an option.
    memset(dst, 0, dst_len);
    return;
  }
  memcpy(dst, src, src_len);
  memset(dst + src_len, 0, dst_len - src_len);
}
#define str2ca(dst, src) __str2ca(__CA_UNWRAP(dst), (src))

static inline void __ca2ca(char *dst, size_t dst_len, char *src,
size_t src_len) {
  BUILD_BUG_ON(dst_len < src_len);
  memcpy(dst, src, src_len);
  if (src_len != dst_len) {
    memset(dst + src_len, 0, dst_len - src_len);
  }
}
#define ca2ca(dst, src) __ca2ca(__CA_UNWRAP(dst), __CA_UNWRAP(src))


And if you want to do direct assignments instead of using helpers, you
make a typedef like this (since just assigning between two equivalent
structs doesn't work):

typedef char_array(20) blah_name;
blah_name global_name;
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  blah_name local_name;
  str2ca(&local_name, argv[1]);
  global_name = local_name;
}

You'd also have to use a typedef like this if you want to pass
references to other functions.


Something like this would also be neat for classic C strings in some
situations - if you can put bounds in the types, or (if the string is
dynamically-sized) in the struct, you don't need to messily pass
around bounds for things like snprint() and so on.

Weeeell... it kinda makes sense if you're trying to micro-optimize the
amount of stack spills. If you write code like this:

char *a = malloc(10);
a = strcpy(a, other_string);
return a;

... then the compiler doesn't have to shove `a` in one of the
callee-saved registers or spill it to the stack around the strcpy().
Plus, it might allow tail-call optimizations in some cases.

You could use it to optimistically attempt a copy in a fastpath, and
then fall back to a reallocation if that failed.

That seems kinda suboptimal. Wouldn't you ideally want to bail out
with an error, or at least do a WARN(), if you're trying to format a
string that doesn't fit into its destination? Like, for example, if
you're assembling a path, and the path doesn't fit into a buffer, and
so you just use half of it, you might end up in a very different place
from where you intended to go.
