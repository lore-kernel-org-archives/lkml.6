It also mirrors the hardware, no?

Yes. There is a lot of common handling for each of these.

It mirrors what the hardware does: you just set an additional bit if
processing has not yet finished.

Because it does on the hardware?

In the future, we should return after we fired off the start etc.
request even if we did not receive an interrupt yet, so that the guest
might do a halt or clear before the start has finished. IOW, make this
as asynchronous as the hardware. That's why I'd like to simply
accumulate the things. The architecture already specified what happens
in the response.

Do you think that is feasible?
