I assume you weren't able to reproduce this?  This crash hasn't been seen again,
and it was reported while KASAN was accidentally disabled in the syzbot kconfig
due to a change to the kconfig menus in linux-next.  So this crash was possibly
caused by slab corruption elsewhere.

I am invalidating the bug for syzbot so it will report the same crash signature
again if it occurs, but if you think there is a real bug feel free to keep
looking into it.

#syz invalid

Thanks,

Eric
