For this particular case I can only recommend to not use the memcg soft
limit. This is guaranteed to stall and there is no way around it because
this is the semantic of the soft limit. Sad, I know.

Regarding other other workloads. AFAIR the problem was due to the
wait_iff_congested in the direct reclaim. And I've been arguing that
special casing __GFP_NORETRY is not a propoer way to handle that case.
We have PF_LESS_THROTTLE to handle cases where the caller cannot be
really throttled because it is a part of the congestion control. I dunno
what happened in that regards since then though.
