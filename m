For GFS2, and I suspect for other fs too, it is really needed. We don't 
want to enter reclaim while holding filesystem locks.

It would be good to fix this, and it has been known as an issue for a 
long time. We might well be able to make use of the new API though. It 
might be as simple as adding the calls when we get & release glocks, but 
I'd have to check the code to be sure,

Steve.
