These 109 patches are equivalent to the syscalls tree in linux-next. Most of
these patches habe been in there for quite a while (the last major batch went
in on March 22; other patches are in there since March 14th).

Conflicts existend with asm-generic and metag (which contain remvoal of some
architectures; I have solved that issue by not caring about those archs any
more); trivial conflicts exist since very few days with the vfs and sparc
trees.

Thanks,
