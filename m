What about when we allow removing an EPC region?  At that point you'd be
fully duplicating KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION.  And that's not a purely
theoretical idea, it's something I'd like to support in the future, e.g.
via the WIP virtio-mem interface.

This would require a dynamic number of private memslots, which breaks (or
at least changes) the semantics of KVM_CAP_NR_MEMSLOTS.

How does Qemu know KVM supports virtual EPC?  Probing /dev/sgx doesn't
convey any information about KVM support.  Maybe you could report it via
KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID, but that would be problematic for Qemu since it
would have to create vCPUs before initializing the machine.

EPC has unique access and lifecycle semantics, but that doesnt make it a
special snowflake, e.g. NVDIMM has special properties, as does memory that
is encrypted via SME or MKTME, and so on and so forth.

The private memslots are private for a reason, e.g. the guest is completely
unaware that they exist and Qemu is only aware of their existence because
KVM needs userspace to tell it what GPA range won't conflict with its memory
model.  And in the APIC access page case, Qemu isn't aware at all since KVM
doesn't allow relocating the guest's APIC.

The other aspect of private memslots is that they are not exposed to L2,
because again, from the guest's perspective, they do not exist.  We can
obviously hackaround that restriction, but it's yet another hint that
shoving EPC into a private memslot is the wrong approach.

In terms of debug, "Qemu" accesses guest memory all the time, e.g. reading
guest memory via Qemu's monitor interface is something I do on a regular
basis.  KVM even provides an ABI (KVM_SET_GUEST_DEBUG) to allow userspace
to set breakpoints on guest memory.  We'd be saying "you can break on
accesses in a debug enclave, but you can't actually access its memory".

Userspace can delete the EPC region via KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION.  As
mentioned above, on-demand deletion of a private memslot means duplicating
basically all of the KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION flow.

For example, consider a paravirtualized guest that allows EPC regions to
be "unplugged" if the host runs out of EPC.

Yes it is.  Allocating EPC via KVM means exporting additional functions
from SGX core, and using a private memslot effectively forces KVM to
allocate guest EPC.  E.g. using KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION and having
SGX own EPC allocation means KVM can be blissfully unaware of VA pages,
EPC swap backing, etc...

I'm all for getting KVM support in ASAP, i.e. I'd love to avoid having to
wait for "full" SGX support, but that doesn't obviate the need to hammer
out the uapi.  Taking a shortcut and shoving everything into KVM could bite
us in the long run.
