Yeah, and when you suspect issues with page pinning, you can try to run
with CONFIG_DEBUG_USER_PAGE_REFERENCES enabled. It's not like the overhead
is going to be huge. But it could be measurable for some workloads...

No, we cannot be sure (the zero page usage within DIO code is one example
when it currently is not true) although usually it is the case that same
type of pages is used for one bio. But bio_add_page() (and thus similarly
bio_add_user_page()) is fine to refuse adding a page to the bio and the
caller then has to submit the current bio and start a new one. So we can
just reuse this mechanism when we detect that currently passed page is of a
different type than other pages in the bio.

Hum, we can always allocate single page filled with zeros for the use by
DIO code itself. But at this point I'm actually not sure why "user pinning"
of zero page would be an issue. After all if you have private anonymous
read-only mapping, it is going to be backed by zero pages and
get_user_pages() and put_user_pages() have to propely detect pin attempts
for these pages and handle them consistently... So DIO code does not seem
to be doing anything that special.

Yeah, at this point I think it is worth it as it's probably going to save
us quite some hair-tearing when debugging stuff.
