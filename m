When DPC is triggered, the port takes the link down.  When we handle
an uncorrectable (nonfatal or fatal) AER event, software takes the
link down.

In both cases, devices on the other side are at least reset.  Whenever
the link goes down, it's conceivable the device could be replaced with
a different one before the link comes back up.  Is this why you remove
and re-enumerate?  (See tangent [1] below.)

The point is that from the device's hardware perspective, these
scenarios are the same (it sent a ERR_NONFATAL or ERR_FATAL message
and it sees the link go down).  I think we should make them the same
on the software side, too: the driver should see the same callbacks,
in the same order, whether we're doing AER or DPC.

If removing and re-enumerating is the right thing for DPC, I think
that means it's also the right thing for AER.

Along this line, we had a question a while back about logging AER
information after a DPC trigger.  Obviously we can't collect any
logged information from the downstream devices while link is down, but
I noticed the AER status bits are RW1CS, which means they're sticky
and are not modified by hot reset or FLR.

So we may be able to read and log the AER information after the DPC
driver brings the link back up.  We may want to do the same with AER,
i.e., reset the downstream devices first, then collect the AER status
bits after the link comes back up.

I agree with this; I think this is heading toward doing
remove/re-enumerate on AER errors as well because it has also reset
the device.

Thanks for this tip.  The only thing I've found so far is the mention
of Surprise Down triggering DPC in the last paragraph of sec 6.7.5.
Are there other references I should look at?  I haven't found the
recommendation about not setting 'Surprise' in Slot Capabilities yet.

[1] Tangent: I have similar concerns with the device reset paths.  We
currently save some config state, reset the device, and restore the
config state.  It's theoretically possible that the device was
replaced or came up with different firmware after the reset, so I
would really prefer to remove and re-enumerate there, too.  But that
would make it hard for things up the stack that want to reset the
device but not re-setup the whole stack.

I wonder if DPC is going to cause trouble for that scenario.  That's
not an argument against DPC, but it might be a stronger reason to
figure out how to deal with remove/re-enumerate in those stacks.
