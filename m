Ah okay, I am curious about that. As far I undetstood now this has
nothing to do with LoRa? I was not getting that point.

Is the PHY layer open? Do they actually refer to 802.15.4 in their
specs, but the PHY layer is changed by... preamble, phy header, MTU?

I keep it in mind, thanks.

I am not quite following here. SOCK_RAW full frame and SOCK_DGRAM
payload sounds like what I suppose it should work.

A switch of protocol will do a switch from ESP to FSK which is a phy layer
behaviour?

Indeed we only need one. :-)

agree.

What are these profiles? For declaring you actually can support some
"window-handle"? Can this be changed during runtime?

Is this some kind of device class specification by EnOcean which need to
be set into their transceiver that a management layer handle it which is
running by firmware?

Share code always sounds like a good idea.

Thanks.
