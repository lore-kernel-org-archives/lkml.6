There's another aspect to this discussion.

You can look at a memory model from three points of view:

1.	To a programmer, the model provides both guarantees (a certain
	code snippet will never yield a particular undesired result)
	and warnings (another snippet might yield an undesired result).

2.	To a CPU designer, the model provides limits on what the
	hardware should be allowed to do (e.g., never execute a store
	before the condition of a preceding conditional branch has been
	determined -- not even if the CPU knows that the store would be
	executed on both legs of the branch).

3.	To a compiler writer, the model provides limits on what code
	manipulations should be allowed.

Linus's comments mostly fall under viewpoint 2 (AFAICT), and a lot of
our thinking to date has been in viewpoint 1.  But viewpoint 3 is the
one most relevant to the code we have been discussing here.

Saying that a control dependency should extend beyond the end of an
"if" statement is basically equivalent to saying that compiler writers
are forbidden to implement certain optimizations.  Now, my experience
has been that compiler writers are loathe to give up an optimization
unless someone can point to a specific part of the language spec and
show that the proposed optimization would violate it.

Given that the LKMM has no official standing whatsoever with the C and 
C++ standards committees, how likely is it that we would be able to 
convince them to change the spec merely to satisfy our desires?

It's all very well for Linus to say "no more 'store done before the
condition it depends on' garbage", but that is an empty rant if we are
unable to exert any pressure on the standards or compiler writers.

Perhaps the best we could hope for would be to have a command-line flag
added to gcc (and LLVM?) that would forbid:

	combining two identical volatile stores in the two legs of an 
	"if" statement and moving the result up before the "if", and

	moving a volatile store up before a preceding "if" statement

(or something along those lines -- even expressing this idea precisely
is a difficult thing to do).  I seriously doubt the standards people
would entertain the idea of making these restrictions universal.  
Especially since the specs currently do not include any notion of
dependency at all.
