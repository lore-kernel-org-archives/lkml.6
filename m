We should not confuse software bugs (like NULL pointer dereference) with
unexpected software behaviour introduced by khwasan where pointers no
longer represent only an address range (e.g. calling find_vmap_area())
but rather an address and a tag. Parts of the kernel rely on pointers
being just address ranges.

It's the latter that we'd like to identify more easily and avoid subtle
bugs or change in behaviour when running correctly written code.

Again, you are talking about the bugs that khwasan would discover. We
don't deny its value and false positives are acceptable here.

However, not untagging a pointer when converting to long may have
side-effects in some cases and I consider these bugs introduced by the
khwasan support rather than bugs in the original kernel code. Ideally
we'd need some tooling on top of khwasan to detect such shortcomings but
I'm not sure we can do this statically, as Andrey already mentioned. For
__user pointers, things are slightly better as we can detect the
conversion either with sparse (modified) or some LLVM changes.
