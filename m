modify() is optional.  host/controller layers may override it.
It was just a proposal to avoid race issues which happens in SMP environment and
solves other issues. I agree, nothing great anyhow can be done in
lockless config

Issue needs to be addressed and that is our goal.
Some times simple mistakes need lot of debugging which happened in my case and
my suggestion is to just avoid. SMP related issues are popping up now
so we just need
to be careful.

Same pci bridge master, memory bit setting concern only (which my
colleague Srinath figured
out after lot of effort some time back) where only one bit in
PCI_COMMAND  was getting set.
(Bug 200793 - PCI: read-write config operation doesn't look like SMP safe)
My approach is to handle with modify operations at lower level so bits
are not over-written or lost.


As stated earlier, issue should be just resolved in better way. No
issue in going with majority
