Like in v2, I don't understand why you need a mb() before the read
from CORE_VENDOR_SPEC.  No reads or writes to the core_mem will affect
the value you're reading here, so you need no barrier.

If you need a barrier before the _write_ to CORE_VENDOR_SPEC then add
it below.  Then in the case where the config doesn't change you have
no barriers.

For the above comment, what about just:

new_config = config
if (msm_host->caps_0 == CORE_1_8V_SUPPORT) {
  new_config |= CORE_IO_PAD_PWR_SWITCH;
} else if (msm_host->caps_0 == CORE_3_3V_SUPPORT) {
  new_config &= ~CORE_IO_PAD_PWR_SWITCH;
} else if (msm_host->caps_0 & CORE_VOLT_SUPPORT) {
  if (io_level & REQ_IO_HIGH)
    new_config &= ~CORE_IO_PAD_PWR_SWITCH;
  else if (io_level & REQ_IO_LOW)
    new_config |= CORE_IO_PAD_PWR_SWITCH;
}
if (config != new_config) {
 ...
}

AKA: first check if it only supports one voltage and pick that one.
Else if it supports both you can use the request.  This might be more
important if you get rid of the initial setting in
sdhci_msm_set_regulator_caps() as I'm suggesting.

Wow, for a driver that tries so hard to use "relaxed" versions of
writes to avoid barriers you sure end up needing to sprinkle a lot of
these around "just in case".  :(  ...this one seems extra fishy
because:

* There are no more accesses after this one in this function.

* If you're worried about something that happens outside of the
context of the IRQ needing this wb() then that's a silly concern.
Presumably if they were doing anything that could race with you they'd
have a lock and locking routines are implicit barriers.

* In the context of the IRQ itself the next call is
sdhci_msm_complete_pwr_irq_wait(), which eventually calls wake_up.
This has a locking primitive and thus an implicit barrier.

* There's a direct call of sdhci_msm_handle_pwr_irq() from probe, and
it has a big fat mb().  I have a hard time believing that matters too
because I'd bet "platform_get_irq_byname" has at least one lock in it.


IMHO these "_relaxed" calls are just not worth it except in _very_
targeted usage.

Slight nit that there's a tab character after "caps &".  Please
replace it with a space.

Are you sure that's right?  In English:

* If we requested high and we support high then set to high.
* else if we requested low __or__ we support low then set low.

Things that are weird above that:

* If we request low but don't support low, switch to low anyway.
* If we request high but only support low, switch to low anyway.

If nothing else seems like this would deserve a comment, but I'd be
curious of the justification for that logic.


Also: seems like this is duplicated code between here and
sdhci_msm_handle_pwr_irq().  Does it even need to be here?  Can't you
just move the call to sdhci_msm_set_regulator_caps() before the call
to sdhci_msm_handle_pwr_irq() in probe?  Then just let that first call
to to sdhci_msm_handle_pwr_irq() do this work?  In
sdhci_msm_handle_pwr_irq() you can always just "OR" in
CORE_IO_PAD_PWR_SWITCH_EN
