I think the code should look at the bridge address <0x0800 ...> we list
in bindings for resolving interrupts in this case, but it seems like it
use the 'pdev->defvn << 8' which is not really we want and will lead to
mismatch.

		interrupt-map-mask = <0xf800 0 0 7>;
		interrupt-map = <0x0000 0 0 1 ...>,
				<0x0000 0 0 2 ...>,
				<0x0000 0 0 3 ...>,
				<0x0000 0 0 4 ...>,

				 0x0800 0 0 1 ...>,
				 0x0800 0 0 2 ...>,
				 0x0800 0 0 3 ...>,
				 0x0800 0 0 4 ...>;
		...
		pcie@1,0 {
			reg = <0x0800 0 0 0 0>;
			...
		};


Or, alternatively, we could add a interrupt-map property in both child
and root node to solve this. The below example is my original version as
I don't want to change that function either.

		interrupt-map-mask = <0xf800 0 0 0>;
		interrupt-map = <0x0000 0 0 0 ...>,
				 0x0800 0 0 0 ...>;
		...
		pcie@1,0 {
			reg = <0x0800 0 0 0 0>;
			#interrupt-cells = <1>;
			interrupt-map-mask = <0 0 0 0>;
			interrupt-map = <0 0 0 0 ...>;
			...
		};

However, I can't find any other similar case in documentation.

Thanks.
