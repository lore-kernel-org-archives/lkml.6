If you call a wr_memcpy() function with the signature you suggested,
then you can overwrite any memory of this type.  Having a different
mm_struct under the hood makes no difference.  As far as I'm
concerned, for *dynamically allocated* rare-writable memory, you might
as well allocate all the paging structures at the same time, so the
mm_struct will always contain the mappings.  If there are serious bugs
in wr_memcpy() that cause it to write to the wrong place, we have
bigger problems.

I can imagine that we'd want a *typed* wr_memcpy()-like API some day,
but that can wait for v2.  And it still doesn't obviously need
multiple mm_structs.

If a malicious module is loaded, the game is over.

I think it's entirely reasonable for the API to internally break up
very large memcpys.
