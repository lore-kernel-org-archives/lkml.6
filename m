Wow, that's suprising.  A quick search suggests that this may be Debian
specific[1], e.g. my Ubuntu systems have:

crw-rw---- 1 root kvm 10, 232 Jan  9 09:30 /dev/kvm

VMs by nature allow a user to bypass all sorts of restrictions, e.g. the
kernel doesn't let userspace run arbitrary cpl0 code, but launch a VM
and voila.  It's what you can do with the new privileges that matters.

MAC systems exist to protect assets, and IMO an enclave isn't an asset.
E.g. AppArmor (via LSM) isn't protecting files, it's protecting the
contents of the file or what can be done with the file.  And the MAC
is only part of the overall protection scheme, e.g. userspace is also
relying on the kernel to not screw up the page tables.

In SGX terms, a LSM hook might use enclave signatures to protect some
asset 'X', e.g. access to persistent identifier.  But that doesn't mean
that whitelisting enclave signatures is the only way to protect 'X'.

Agreed, but that's not same as applying a host's whitelist against a
guest's enclaves.
