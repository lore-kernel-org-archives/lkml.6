Note that generic page write protection has such object, kind of like
stable_node in KSM. You overwritte page->mapping to point to this
generic struct which has a pointer to set of callback so that whatever
is protecting the page can offer API to break protection (break sharing
here).

So instead of having struct proxy_page -> struct page you would have the
reverse: struct page -> struct proxy and so you do not have to change
much in all the file system beside removing the reliance on page->mapping
which is what most of my patches are about.
