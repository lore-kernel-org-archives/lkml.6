Thanks a lot for testing this.  That's a very good clue that we can
make Linux handle this gracefully, too, even without having to add
Device IDs for every new GPU.

I think we should explore using PCI_COMMAND_INTX_DISABLE.  Old devices
won't support it, so we might need the quirk for them, but new devices
should support it.
