If it just sleeps, then this is not a problem, but if it actually *waits*
for something meaningful to happen (which I guess is what you really mean),
then things may go awry.

So if it waits for an action handler to do something and wake it up, it may
very well deadlock.  I have no idea if that really happens, though.

Action handlers won't run unless the IRQs are marked as IRQF_NO_SUSPEND
(well, there are a few more complications I don't recall exactly, but
that's the basic rule).  If anything depends on them to run, it will block.
