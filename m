Again, this has nothing that is per-filesystem in it.

If we were to decide to support the notion of "append merkle hashes to
the file for validation" at the vfs layer, the same logic would apply:
obviously the merkle data shouldn't be visible to user space.

But that's not a reason to do it at a filesystem layer, quite the
reverse: exactly like you say, as far as the *filesystem* is
concerned, the data is there in the file. It's literally about the
*view* of the file, ie the system call interface:

To me that only argues that this all should be at the vfs layer, and
that it shouldn't be the filesystem that hides it. Exactly because as
far as the filesystem is concerned, the merkle data is there, it's
just that we hide it at read (and stat) time.

Preferably some way where it's namespace-dependent or whatever, so
that you could still access the original file data from user space if
you want to (eg some backup purpose or other).

What I'm missing is any kind of sane explanation for why it was done
so badly, and why it should be upstreamed despite the apparent bad
implementation.

It sounds like a complete hack.

Again, to me either the point is that it's a generic extension of the
file data, _or_ it's some filesystem-specific hidden data. The way
you've done it and written the documentation, it's clearly a generic
extension of normal file data, and I don't see what's fs-specific to
it.

So *this* kind of argument is what I'm looking for.

That at least explains why it's not an xattr. Ugly, but understandable.

That seems entirely irrelevant. What do Christoph and Dave have to do
with it once it's generic? It would have _zero_ filesystem component
if it's actually done in a generic manner. It would be a total no-op
to XFS.

Which makes me think "it wasn't actually sold as being
filesystem-independent" at all.

So I want to understand why this was made a filesystem operation in
the first place. What's fs-specific about this implementation?
