You can compile kernel with generic config and at that point you have
all the duplicated code stored on your machine. But this discussion is
moving away from the point I was concerned about -- that this patchset
_increases_ code duplication and I find this wrong.

It does NOT reduce the binary size, just try compiling all the drivers
in and it will make the kernel bigger.
