Ok. I thought we were trying to grab the sink information from the event
drv_config, hence something that implies that would be slightly more
reader friendly. Again, I am not too keen on it.

Ok. The only problem with this approach would be if the devices doesn't appear
on the AMBA bus (btw, which is not true for the existing IPs).

We could add another directory under :

/sys/bus/event_source/devices/<PMU>/
				\_ events/
				\_ format/
say :
		\_ drv_config/
		Or
		\_ sinks/

and list the sinks, eg:
# cd $sysfs_pmu_dir/sinks
# cat <name_of_the_sink>
ID_of_the_sink

Btw, I am always inclined to using some bits off one of the "config" fields
("config1" or "config2") for the sink configuration. But I understand that
you have explored that avenue and chose this approach as we have further
configurations required for complex ETM settings.

Cheers
Suzuki
