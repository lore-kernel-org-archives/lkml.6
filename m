My point is, that perhaps DTS is wrong or too simplified.

Perhaps vmmc can be powered off/on?

Okay. One thing to remove from possible root causes.

Okay. To really be sure, I would also try 1000ms.

Well, in principle that shouldn't matter.

CMD0 is fine to use to wakeup the card from sleep state and that can
be followed by a regular initialization sequence. This is the way the
mmc core, during system resume does it.

Another possible option is that the power to vqmmc becomes power
cycled during reboot, while power to vmmc isn't.

Hope my ideas to narrow down the problem are helping and not adding
confusion. :-)

Kind regards
