I don't really see why we're trying to make a distinction between
recoverable errors and disconnected devices at this stage. In either
case we should assume the device is broken and shouldn't be accessed
until we perform some kind of recovery action.

Bjorn's MMIO wrappers are more-or-less an opt-in software emulation of
the freeze-MMIO-on-error behaviour that the EEH mechanism provides on 
IBM hardware so I think it makes sense. It also has the nice side
effect of giving driver writers an error injection mechanism so they
might actually test how their drivers deal with errors.

Is doing a MMIO to a device in D3cold (or hot) ever a valid thing to
do?

The herustics shouldn't be used to work out when the device is gone,
rather they should be used to work out when we need to check on the
device.

One of the grosser bits of EEH support is a hook in readl() and friends
that checks for a 0xFF response. If it finds one, it looks at the EEH
state and will start the recovery process if the device is marked as
frozen.

(don't look at the code. you won't like what you find)

Completely agree. We really need better documentation of what drivers
should be doing.
