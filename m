Each mdev is a device, regardless of whether there are hardware
resources committed to the device, so I don't understand this argument.

I don't see how the length of the usage plays a role here either.  Are
you concerned that the time it takes to create and remove an mdev is
significant compared to the usage time?  Userspace is certainly welcome
to create a pool of devices, but why should it be the kernel's
responsibility to dynamically assign resources to an mdev?  What's the
usage model when resources are unavailable?  It seems there's
complexity in either case, but it's generally userspace's responsibility
to impose a policy.

Mdev already provides that when an mdev is removed, the hardware
resources attached to it are released back to the mdev parent device.
A process closing the device simply indicates the end of a usage
context of the device.  It seems like the request here is simply that
allocating resources on open allows userspace to be lazy and overcommit
physical resources without considering what happens when those
resources are unavailable.

Cleaner for who?  It's asking the kernel to impose a policy for
delegating resources when we effectively already have a policy that
userspace is responsible for allocating and delegating resources.

The restriction on the mdev is that the mdev itself represents allocated
resources.  Of course we can always run out, but the current model is
that a user granted access to a vfio device, mdev or otherwise, has
ownership of the hardware provided through that interface.  I don't see
how not committing resources to an mdev is anything more than an
attempt to push policy and error handling from one place to another.
