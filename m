Megaraid and mpt3sas don't have that functionality (or, at least, not 
that I'm aware).
And in general I'm not sure if the above approach is feasible.

Thing is, if we have _managed_ CPU hotplug (ie if the hardware provides 
some means of quiescing the CPU before hotplug) then the whole thing is 
trivial; disable SQ and wait for all outstanding commands to complete.
Then trivially all requests are completed and the issue is resolved.
Even with todays infrastructure.

And I'm not sure if we can handle surprise CPU hotplug at all, given all 
the possible race conditions.
But then I might be wrong.

Cheers,

Hannes
