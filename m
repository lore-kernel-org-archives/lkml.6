To further add to what Paolo said and better expose the problem, I'd like to
say that all those proposals have issues.
If we only allow "same output" cftypes to be shared then we lose all the
flexibility of this solution, and we need a way for an entity to know other
entities internal variables beforehand, which sounds at least very hard, and
maybe is not even an acceptable thing to do.
To put the average, sum or some other mathematical function in the file only
makes sense for certain cftypes, so also doesn't sound like a good idea. In
fact I can think of scenarios where only seeing the different values of the
entities makes sense for a user.

I understand that the problem is inconsistency: having a file that behaves
differently depending on the situation, and the only way to prevent this I can
think of is to *always* show the entity owner of a certain file (or part of the
output), even when the output would be the same among entities or when the
file is not currently shared but could be. Can this be an acceptable solution?
