Hi,

Not sure if this is a known issue, I'm seeing this with latest mainline
kernel on Fedora rawhide.

The wireless networking is not stable, I can not access network any more after
downloading some big files or just browsing some web pages about some
time.  I do not see this when I work in office.  So this maybe relate to
wireless router.

"Can not access network" means ping timeout, can not open web pages etc.
But the wireless connection looks normal at least from the
NetworkManager icon it is still connected.

The router I used at home is an old ASUS WL520gc.  I can confirm I can
reproduce this with another ASUA router WL-500gP v2 

My laptop model is Thinkpad T480s.  It is painful I can only use
wireless,  any hints how to make it work will be appreciated!
