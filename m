Probably should have cc'd linux-fsdevel, too, but it's too late for
that now....

Just FYI, I won't be at LSFMM.

Puerto Rico is about as physically far away from me as you can get
on this planet. There's 40 hours in transit from airport to airport,
and that doesn't include the 5 hours of travel the day before (and
hence overnight stay) to be able to get to the first airport in time
for the first flight. I'm looking at a transit time - if all goes
well - of over 60 hours just to get to the conference.

And it's looks like it will be just as bad on the way back.

6 days travel for a 2 day conference makes no sense at all.

Cheers,

Dave.
