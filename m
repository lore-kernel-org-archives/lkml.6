Wait.  Don't you need to restart from the beginning of the list in
this case?  Or does the list never have anything added to it and is
rcu_conn initially the first element in the list?

Linus is correct to doubt this code.  You assign a pointer to the current
element to rcu_conn, which is presumably a per-CPU or global variable.
So far, so good ...

... except that some other CPU might well remove the entry referenced by
rcu_conn at this point.  It would have to wait for a grace period (e.g.,
synchronize_rcu()), but the current CPU has exited its RCU read-side
critical section, and therefore is not blocking the grace period.
Therefore, by the time get_and_set_next_conn() picks up rcu_conn, it
might well be referencing the freelist, or, even worse, some other type
of structure.

What is your code doing to prevent this from happening?  (There are ways,
but I want to know what you were doing in this case.)

That would not help at all because you are still leaking the pointer out
of the RCU read-side critical section.  That is completely and utterly
broken unless you are somehow cleaning up rcu_conn when you remove
the element.  And getting that cleanup right is -extremely- tricky.
Unless you have some sort of proof of correctness, you will get a NACK
from me.

More like this:

	list_for_each_entry_rr_rcu(conn, &conn_list, entry) {
		do_something_with(conn);
		if (done_for_now())
			break;
	}

Let's start with the basics:  It absolutely does not make sense to leak
pointers across rcu_read_unlock() unless you have arranged something else
to protect the pointed-to data in the meantime.  There are a number of ways
of implementing this protection.  Again, what protection are you using?

Your code at the above URL looks plausible to me at first glance: You
do rcu_read_lock(), a loop with list_for_each_entry_rcu_rr(), then
rcu_read_unlock().  But at second glance, it looks like htcx->queue
might have the same vulnerability as rcu_conn in your earlier code.
