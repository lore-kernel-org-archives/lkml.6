Having worked on ixgbe a bit, I have to wonder what kind of havoc would ensue if an ixgbe device were assigned to a guest, and an attempt was made to allocate VFs by the pci-stub. The guest could be running any version of the ixgbe driver, possibly even an old one that didn't support SR-IOV. Even if it did support SR-IOV, I don't know how it would respond to mailbox messages when it doesn't think it has VFs.

It isn't global. It is per PF. There is a sysfs value per PF called
"sriov_drivers_autoprobe" that currently controls if VFs are
automatically bound by drivers from the kernel. What I am suggesting
is we split that value, and then add a new one called
"sriov_unmanaged_autoprobe" to handle the case where either there is
no driver on the PF or the driver loaded doesn't support SR-IOV. The
default behavior for it would be to be disabled by default so if VFs
are spawned by an unmanaged PF the drivers don't load on them by
default. The root user can toggle the sysfs entry if they want that
behavior to change.

The idea based on a request by Alex Williamson that we prevent VF
drivers from loading in the host if a PF is managed by user-space or a
firmware entity and we don't have a clear way of configuring VFs from
the kernel.
