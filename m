Vivek and I talked, and I believe the SELinux check on Entrypoint is 
wrong.  We should be checking on the overlay context not on the lower 
level label for entrypoint.


A little back ground.  Entrypoint check is looking at the target domain 
whether it can be entered via the executable.


For example we might have a label like apache_t and apache_exec_t, we 
would write a rules like:


allow apache_t apache_exec_t:file entrypoint.

allow user_t apache_t:process transition

allow user_t apache_file_t:file execute

allow user_t bin_t:file execute


These rules say a process running as user_t can execute files labeles 
apache_exec_t and bin_t.  It also says that the user_t type can 
transition or start a process as apache_t, BUT since we have the 
entrypoint rule, the only type that user_t can transition to apache_t is 
the apache_exec_t type.

This would prevent user_t from executing something like

runcon -t apache_t /bin/sh


In the case of these tests currently SELinux is verifying that the 
mounter is able to mount a directory with a different label rwx_t, and 
then providing the user with content via this label. So the entrypoint 
check should happen on the new context label, not on the lower label.  
We need to fix the SELinux test suite to reflect the new behaviour.  I 
think the current test and current code is actually a bug.


would say that the apache_t process type can be entered via
