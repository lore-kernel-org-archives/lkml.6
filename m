I think we have to consider the struct pages to track the address space,
not what backs it (essentially what HMM is doing). If we need to add
operations for the driver to map the address space/struct pages back to
physical memory then do that. Creating a whole new idea that's tied to
userspace VMAs still seems wrong to me.
