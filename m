I guess this is similar to Dave's comment: Why is i_size so special? What
makes sure that file didn't get modified between time you've prepared
cached_page and now such that you need to do the preparation again?
And if indeed metadata prepared for a page cannot change, what's so special
about it being that particular cached_page?

Maybe to phrase my objections differently: Your preparations in
btrfs_page_mkwrite() are obviously related to your filesystem metadata. So
why cannot you infer from that metadata (extent tree, whatever - I'd use
extent status tree in ext4) whether that particular file+offset is already
prepared for writing and just bail out with success in that case?
