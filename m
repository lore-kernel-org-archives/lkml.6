Yes, you are on track. Basically; for all callers in drivers directory,
I was trying to call hotplug reset as in (1/2) of this patch before
secondary bus reset.

I learnt about this during our DPC+hotplug interaction thread here:

https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-pci/list/?submitter=77241

Existing issues:

I think we should go ahead and combine slot reset and secondary bus
reset into a single API and hide the other ones (pci_reset_slot() and
pci_reset_bridge_secondary_bus()) from external users. This way,
people don't have to query if system supports hotplug or not like VFIO
does.

Other drivers (AER/IB) not doing this are broken in hotplug systems today.
