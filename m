For _your_ use case, yes.  For mine and Andy's and someone else's in the
future, it might be :)

You are creating a very generic, new, user/kernel api that a whole bunch
of people are going to want to use.  Let's not hamper the ability for us
all to use this right from the beginning please.

We have userspace drivers for USB today, being able to drag that
out-of-tree codebase into the kernel is a _HUGE_ bonus, and something
that I would love to do for a lot of reasons.  I also can see moving
some of our existing in-kernel drivers out of the kernel in a way that
provides "it just works" functionality by using this type of feature.

So again, please don't prevent us from using this, otherwise you should
be just calling this "bpf_usermode_helper" :)

Oh, and for the record, I like Andy's proposal as well as dumping this
into a kernel module "blob" with the exception that this now would take
up unswapable memory, which isn't the nicest and is one big reason we
removed the in-kernel-memory firmware blobs many years ago.

thanks,
