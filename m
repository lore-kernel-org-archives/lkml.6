This will make it easier to track and easier to understand
what components and features are part of the FW_LOADER. There
are some components related to firmware which have *nothing* to
do with the FW_LOADER, souch as PREVENT_FIRMWARE_BUILD.

-
-	  You typically want this built-in (=y) but you can also enable this
-	  as a module, in which case the firmware_class module will be built.

-	help
-	  Device drivers which require firmware can typically deal with
-	  having the kernel load firmware from the various supported
-	  /lib/firmware/ paths. This option enables you to build into the
-	  kernel firmware files. Built-in firmware searches are preceeded
-	  over firmware lookups using your filesystem over the supported
-	  /lib/firmware paths documented on CONFIG_FW_LOADER.
-
-	  This may be useful for testing or if the firmware is required early on
-	  in boot and cannot rely on the firmware being placed in an initrd or
-	  initramfs.
-
-	  This option is a string and takes the (space-separated) names of the
-	  firmware files -- the same names that appear in MODULE_FIRMWARE()
-	  and request_firmware() in the source. These files should exist under
-	  the directory specified by the EXTRA_FIRMWARE_DIR option, which is
-	  /lib/firmware by default.
-
-	  For example, you might set CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE="usb8388.bin", copy
-	  the usb8388.bin file into /lib/firmware, and build the kernel. Then
-	  any request_firmware("usb8388.bin") will be satisfied internally
-	  inside the kernel without ever looking at your filesystem at runtime.
-
-	  WARNING: If you include additional firmware files into your binary
-	  kernel image that are not available under the terms of the GPL,
-	  then it may be a violation of the GPL to distribute the resulting
-	  image since it combines both GPL and non-GPL work. You should

-	help
-	  This option enables a sysfs loading facility to enable firmware

-	  if and only if the kernel's direct filesystem lookup for the
-	  firmware failed using the different /lib/firmware/ paths, or the
-	  path specified in the firmware_class path module parameter, or the
-	  firmware_class path kernel boot parameter if the firmware_class is
-	  built-in. For details on how to work with the sysfs fallback mechanism
-	  refer to Documentation/driver-api/firmware/fallback-mechanisms.rst.
-
-	  The direct filesystem lookup for firwmare is always used first now.
-
-	  If the kernel's direct filesystem lookup for firware fails to find
-	  the requested firmware a sysfs fallback loading facility is made
-	  available and userspace is informed about this through uevents.
-	  The uevent can be supressed if the driver explicitly requested it,
-	  this is known as the driver using the custom fallback mechanism.
-	  If the custom fallback mechanism is used userspace must always
-	  acknowledge failure to find firmware as the timeout for the fallback
-	  mechanism is disabled, and failed requests will linger forever.
-
-	  This used to be the default firmware loading facility, and udev used
-	  to listen for uvents to load firmware for the kernel. The firmware
-	  loading facility functionality in udev has been removed, as such it
-	  can no longer be relied upon as a fallback mechanism. Linux no longer
-	  relies on or uses a fallback mechanism in userspace. If you need to
-	  rely on one refer to the permissively licensed firmwared:
-
-	  https://github.com/teg/firmwared
-
-	  Since this was the default firmware loading facility at one point,
-	  old userspace may exist which relies upon it, and as such this
-	  mechanism can never be removed from the kernel.
-
-	  You should only enable this functionality if you are certain you
-	  require a fallback mechanism and have a userspace mechanism ready to
-	  load firmware in case it is not found. One main reason for this may
-	  be if you have drivers which require firmware built-in and for
-	  whatever reason cannot place the required firmware in initramfs.
-	  Another reason kernels may have this feature enabled is to support a
-	  driver which explicitly relies on this fallback mechanism. Only two
-	  drivers need this today:
-
-	    o CONFIG_LEDS_LP55XX_COMMON
-	    o CONFIG_DELL_RBU
-
-	  Outside of supporting the above drivers, another reason for needing
-	  this may be that your firmware resides outside of the paths the kernel
-	  looks for and cannot possibily be specified using the firmware_class
-	  path module parameter or kernel firmware_class path boot parameter
-	  if firmware_class is built-in.
-
-	  A modern use case may be to temporarily mount a custom partition
-	  during provisioning which is only accessible to userspace, and then
-	  to use it to look for and fetch the required firmware. Such type of
-	  driver functionality may not even ever be desirable upstream by
-	  vendors, and as such is only required to be supported as an interface
-	  for provisioning. Since udev's firmware loading facility has been
-	  removed you can use firmwared or a fork of it to customize how you
-	  want to load firmware based on uevents issued.
-
-	  Enabling this option will increase your kernel image size by about
-	  13436 bytes.
-

-	  certain you need to support some really custom firmware loading
