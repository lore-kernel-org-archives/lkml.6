Sure, I meant it's not true in the wq flush code, not talking about
anything else.

sure, I thought that was easy:

thread 1			thread 2 (wq thread)

common_case = false;
queue_work(&my_wq, &work);
mutex_lock(&mutex);

flush_workqueue(&my_wq);
				work_function()
				-> mutex_lock(&mutex);
				-> schedule(), wait for mutex
wait_for_completion()

-> deadlock - we can't make any forward progress here.

Yes, but I'm saying that we should catch *potential* deadlocks *before*
they happen.

See the example above. Clearly, you're actually deadlocking, and
obviously (assuming all the wait_for_completion() things work right)
lockdep will show why we just deadlocked.

BUT.

This is useless. We want/need lockdep to show *potential* deadlocks,
even when they didn't happen. Consider the other case in the above
scenario:

thread 1			thread 2 (wq thread)

common_case = true;
queue_work(&my_wq, &work);

schedule_and_wait_...();	work_function()
				-> mutex_lock(&mutex);
				-> mutex_unlock()
				done


mutex_lock(&mutex);
flush_workqueue(&my_wq);
-> nothing to do, will NOT
   call wait_for_completion();

-> no deadlock

Here we don't have a deadlock, but without the revert we will also not
get a lockdep report. We should though, because we're doing something
that's quite clearly dangerous - we simply don't know if the work
function will complete before we get to flush_workqueue(). Maybe the
work function has an uncommon case itself that takes forever, etc.

No. See above. We want the annotation regardless of invoking
wait_for_completion().

See above.

You're getting too hung up about a deadlock example. We don't want to
have lockdep only catch *actual* deadlocks. The code I wrote clearly has
a potential deadlock (sequence given above), but in most cases the code
above will *not* deadlock. This is the interesting part we want lockdep
to catch.

Yes.

No, here's where you get confused. Clearly, there is no lockdep if we
don't do wait_for_completion(). But if you have the code above, lockdep
should still warn about the potential deadlock that happens when you
*do* get to wait_for_completion(). Lockdep shouldn't be restricted to
warning about a deadlock that *actually* happened.
