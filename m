I double checked, and I don't see where you get EINVAL for this case.
We *do* keep the sb frozen though, which is good, and the worst fear
I had was that we did not. However we return 0 if there was already
a prior freeze_bdev() or ioctl_fsfreeze() other than the context that
started the prior freeze (--bdev->bd_fsfreeze_count > 0).

The -EINVAL is only returned currently if there were no freezers.

int thaw_bdev(struct block_device *bdev, struct super_block *sb)
{
	int error = -EINVAL;

	mutex_lock(&bdev->bd_fsfreeze_mutex);
	if (!bdev->bd_fsfreeze_count)
		goto out;

	error = 0;
	if (--bdev->bd_fsfreeze_count > 0)
		goto out;
	...
out:
	mutex_unlock(&bdev->bd_fsfreeze_mutex);
	return error;
}

  Luis
