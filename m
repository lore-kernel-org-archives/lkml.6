If I recall the purpose of accessing the MM during de-register is to
undo the pinned pages change (pinned_vm) that register performed.

So, the semantic is simple, during deregister we must access excatly
the same MM that was used during register and undo the change to
pinned_vm.

The approach should be to find the most reliably way to hold a
reference to the MM that was used during register.

Apparently we can't just hold a ref on the mm (according to mm_get's
comment at least)

tgid is clearly a better indirect reference to the mm than pid (pid is
so obviously wrong)

But I am wondering why not just hold struct task here instead of tgid?
Isn't task->mm going to be more reliably than tgid->task->mm ??
