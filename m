Sorry if I'm beating a dead horse, but what if we only did fixup on ENCLU
with a specific (ignored) prefix pattern?  I.e. effectively make the magic
fixup opt-in, falling back to signals.  Jamming RIP to skip ENCLU isn't
that far off the architecture, e.g. EENTER stuffs RCX with the next RIP so
that the enclave can EEXIT to immediately after the EENTER location.

No clue, I'll ask and report back.
