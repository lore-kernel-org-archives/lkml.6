For per-plane dirty property patches, which ones do you refer to?

Then for xorg, there's my second attempt on fixing the command mode
rotation at [0]. Not sure if that's enough for a fix?

It seems not very efficient to me and I don't really know where
the the per crtc dirty flag should be stored..

I can easily test patches though with a command mode LCD and normal
HDMI setup on droid 4.

Tony
