For GPU it would not work, GPU might want to use main memory (because
it is running out of BAR space) it is a lot easier if the p2p_map
callback calls the right dma map function (for page or io) rather than
having to define some format that would pass down the information.

Struct page do not fit well for GPU as the BAR address can be reprogram
to point to any page inside the device memory (think 256M BAR versus
16GB device memory). Forcing struct page on GPU driver would require
major surgery to the GPU driver inner working and there is no benefit
to have from the struct page. So it is hard to justify this.
