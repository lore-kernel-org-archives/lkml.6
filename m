I had cleaned up legacy interrupt handling in keystone driver [1] which was
also required for TI's AM654 Platform.

But I guess the same issue will occur in MSI interrupt handling. I'll fix that
up in the next version. Btw can you review [2] so that I can fix any other
comments that you may have.

Thanks
