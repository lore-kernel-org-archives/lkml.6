So, Zinc will simultaneously replace the current crypto implementations, *and*
be "orthogonal" and "separate" from all the crypto code currently maintained by
Herbert?  You can't have your cake and eat it too...

I'm still concerned you're splitting the community in two.  It will be unclear
where new algorithms and implementations should go.  Some people will choose
Herbert and the current crypto API and conventions, and some people will choose
you and Zinc...  I still don't see clear guidelines for what will go where.  And
yes, you and Herbert will step on each others' toes and duplicate stuff, as the
efforts are *not* separate, as you've even argued yourself.

Please reach out to Herbert to find a sane solution, ideally one that involves
having a single git tree for crypto development and allows people to continue
crypto development without choosing "sides".

So, crypto implementations and algorithms will go to different maintainers,
source locations, and git trees based purely on whether the current users need
"cipher agility"?  Note that usage can change over time; a user that requires a
single cipher could later need multiple, and vice versa.

What if the portion of a wireless driver that needs SM4 doesn't need any other
cipher in the same place, so static dispatch would suffice?  Would SM4 be
allowed in Zinc then?

Matches Andy's code, where?  The reason you had to add the radix conversion is
because his code does *not* handle it...

Sorry, other people don't know about your private discussions.  For the rest of
us, why not add a comment to the code explaining what's going on?

AFAICS actually it *is* rubbish, because your C code stores the accumulator as
64-bit integers whereas the asm code (at least, the 32-bit version) reads it as
32-bit integers.  That won't work correctly on big endian ARM.

Apparently not, given that it's broken on big endian ARM.

The details of the correctness proofs and fuzzing you claim to have done aren't
explained, even in the cover letter; so for now we just have to trust you on
that point.  Of course, having bugs in code which you insist was proven correct
+ fuzzed doesn't exactly inspire trust.

I understand that your standards are still as high or even higher than
Herbert's, which is good; crypto code should be held to high standards!  But
based on the evidence, I do worry there's a double standard going on where you
get away with things yourself which you won't allow from others in Zinc.  It's
just not honest, and it will make people not want to contribute to Zinc.
Maintainers are supposed to be unbiased and hold all contributions to the same
standard.

We need "Zinc" to be Linux's crypto library, not "Jason's crypto library".
