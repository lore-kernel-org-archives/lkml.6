I've added some log after 'for loop':

pr_err("busn=0x%x, devfn=0x%x, reg=0x%x\n", pdev->bus->number, pdev->devfn, of_pci_get_devfn(ppnode));

and got these:

[    5.651836] busn=0x0, devfn=0x0, reg=0x0
[    5.651936] pcieport 0000:00:00.0: assign IRQ: got 213
...
[    5.652398] busn=0x0, devfn=0x8, reg=0x0
[    5.652487] pcieport 0000:00:01.0: assign IRQ: got 214

...
[    5.653025] busn=0x2, devfn=0x0, reg=0x8
[    5.653058] igb 0000:02:00.0: assign IRQ: got 213

[    5.724634] igb 0000:02:00.1: assign IRQ: got 213

Thanks for explanation.

So I guess the better way to achieve my aim - one IRQ per slot that is
connected to all INTx and get propagated through the bridges (and for
those root ports own interrupts (PME ..)} is to add interrupt-map
properties in both parent and root port nodes.

Something like this: https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9970923/ ,right?
