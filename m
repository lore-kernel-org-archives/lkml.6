I agree it's not a significant amount of entropy, but even just one bit
could mean a long stall if that put us over the edge of just not having
enough for whatever is blocking on /dev/random. Mikael's boot did have a
CDROM, it's not impossible that the handful of commands we end up doing
to that device would have contributed enough entropy to get the boot
done without stalling for minutes.

One way to know for sure, and that's if Mikael tests the patch.
