Agreed the original code did the opposite of what the user wanted, looks like
when I authored it I messed up that enum which set everything off.

For the new ioctl I think we should just add a new enum with the correct
nomenclature.  So OPAL_MBR_DONE, OPAL_MBR_NOT_DONE.

I think it is just wrong.

Can we keep the old mbr struct the same and just add a new struct with new enums
for the new done ioctl? I think this will keep the new ioctl cleaner instead
of trying to apply older, some what incorrectly named, enums.

Lastly someone will need to backport his

to stable so we can fix up my broken coding in older kernels.


I can do that or, if David wants to do that that's fine... just want to coordinate.
