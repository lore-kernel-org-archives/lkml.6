The child check I'm talking about prevents setting a task's audit
container ID if it *has* any children or threads, so if it has children
it is automatically disqualified and its grandchildren are irrelevant.

Would c_containerid and p_containerid be ok?  child_cid and parent_cid?
I'd really like it to have the same root as the parameter handed in so
teh code is easier to follow.  It would be nice to have that across
caller to local, but that's challenging.

I've been tempted to use contid or even cid everywhere instead of
containerid.  Perhaps the longer name doesn't bother me because I
like its uniqueness and I learned touch-typing in grade 9 and I like
100+ character wide terminals?  ;-)

A task's audit container ID can be unset or inherited, and then set
only once.  After that, if you want it moved to a new container you
can't and your only option is to spawn another peer to that task or a
child of it and set that new task's audit container ID.

Currently, the method of detecting if its audit container ID has been
set (rather than inherited) was to check its parent's audit container
ID.  The only reason to change this might be if the audit container ID
were not inheritable, but then we lose the accountability of a task
spawning another process and being able to leave its child's audit
container ID unset and unaccountable to any existing container.  I think
the relationship to the parent is crucial, and if something wants to
change audit container ID it can, by spawning childrent and leaving a
trail of container IDs in its parent processes.  (So what if a parent
dies?)

> ... or does the orchestrator change that?  *Can* the orchestrator
> change real_parent (I suspect the answer is "no")?

I don't think the orchestrator is able to change real_parent.  I've
forgotten why there is a ->parent and ->real_parent and how they can
change.  One is for the wait signal.  I don't remember the purpose of
the other.

If the parent dies before the child, the child will be re-parented on
its grandparent if the parent doesn't hang around zombified, if I
understand correctly.  If anything, a parent dying would likely further
restrict the ability to set a task's audit container ID because a parent
with an identical ID could vanish.

Currently, a process with CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL can set the audit container
ID of any task that hasn't got children or threads, isn't itself, and
its audit container ID is inherited or unset.  This was to try to
prevent games with parents and children scratching each other's backs.

I would feel more comfortable if only descendants were settable, so
adding that restriction sounds like a good idea to me other than the
tree-climbing excercise and overhead involved.

Perhaps I'm just being quite dense, but I just don't follow what the
problem is and how you suggest fixing it.  A bunch of gotos to a label
such as "out:" to log the refused action?  That seems messy and
unstructured.
