No, we will have to add support for separate phys as sdm845 has phy per 
each lane,
and the older struct phy will exist alongside.
We will call this function only with the older phy pointer.

Right, so we create new struct phy while keeping older one intact to 
keep the
ufs-qcom work with both - ufs_qcom_phy and qmp_phy.
Some of the controller drivers, such as usb/dwc3/ keep support for old 
and new phys,
although there the difference is between generic phy and the usb-phy.
So, I am assuming that if we want to keep ufs-qcom on platforms using 20nm,
14nm and 10nm phys happy, we will have to keep the phys separately for 
sometime.
What do you say about it?

On db820c, we can still work with the ufs_qcom_phy.
