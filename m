Mmm, it actually makes some sort of sense to me that as long as parent
groups can't load balance (because !sched_load_balance) and this group
can't have CPUs overlapping with some other group (because
cpu_exclusive) a data structure (root_domain) is created to handle load
balancing for this isolated subsystem. I agree that it should be better
documented, though.

OK, thanks for confirming. Can you tell again however why do you think
we need to remove sched_load_balance from root level? Won't we end up
having tasks put on isolated sets?

Also, I guess children groups with more than one CPU will need to be
able to load balance across their CPUs, no matter what their parent
group does?

Thanks,
