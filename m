No, it's not just signal-delivery context. It's _also_ called from
return to usermode loop, which can by called on return from
interrupt/trap/syscall.

This would take care of my security concern wrt abort_ip, but would not
provide consistent behavior for the other fields. Also, perhaps this
kind of change should aim the next merge window ?

This would only handle the "security" part of the matter, which
is specifically related to rseq->rseq_cs->abort_ip.

What is left is ensuring that we have consistent behavior for
other fields:

[ Note: we have introduced this helper macro: LINUX_FIELD_u32_u64
which defines a field which is 64-bit for 64-bit processes, and 32-bit
with 32-bit of padding for 32-bit processes. ]

* rseq->rseq_cs: (userspace pointer to user-space, updated by user-space
  with single-copy atomicity): current type: LINUX_FIELD_u32_u64,
  cannot be changed to __u64 due to single-copy atomicity requirement,

* rseq->rseq_cs->start_ip: currently a LINUX_FIELD_u32_u64,
  could become a __u64,

* rseq->rseq_cs->post_commit_ip: currently a LINUX_FIELD_u32_u64,
  could become a __u64,

* rseq->rseq_cs->abort_ip: currently a LINUX_FIELD_u32_u64,
  could become a __u64,

For abort_ip, changing the type to __u64 and using the
instruction_pointer_validate() approach you propose would work.

For start_ip and post_commit_ip, we need to decide whether we
want to kill a 32-bit process setting the high bits or if we just
accept and use the full __u64 content on both 32-bit and 64-bit
kernels. Those two fields are only used for arithmetic comparison.
Using the full __u64 content means using 64-bit arithmetic on
32-bit native kernels though.

If we decide to kill the offending process (whether the field type is
__u64 or LINUX_FIELD_u32_u64), we need to be able to figure out if
the process is a compat task when called from signal delivery and from
return to usermode loop (return from irq/trap/syscall).

Comparison with TASK_SIZE solves the issue for abort_ip, post_commit_ip
and start_ip, although nobody seems to like that approach very much.

For rseq->rseq_cs, we cannot use __u64 due to single-copy atomicity
update requirement for 32-bit processes. However, we are using this
field in a copy_from_user(), so it will EFAULT if the high-bits are
set by a compat 32-bit task on a 64-bit kernel. We can therefore check
that the padding is zeroed explicitly on a native 32-bit kernel to
provide a consistent behavior. Specifically because rseq->rseq_cs is
checked with access_ok(), it is therefore enough to check the padding
when __LP64__ is not defined by the preprocessor.

But rather than trying to play games with input validation, I would
favor an approach that would allow rseq to validate all its inputs
straightforwardly. Introducing user_64bit_mode(struct pt_regs *)
across all architectures would allow doing just that. rseq signal
delivery and return to usermode code could then ensure that high bits are
cleared by 32-bit tasks for all fields and thus provide a consistent
behavior for 32-bit tasks running on 32-bit and 64-bit kernels.

Thoughts ?

Thanks,

Mathieu
