Hi James,
   sorry for my late response due to chines new year.

I have used your suggestion struct

yes, I agreed.

For the Qemu migration, I need to check more the QEMU code.


Hi Andrew,
      I use KVM_GET/SET_VCPU_EVENTS IOCTL to migrate the Serror
exception status of VM,
The even struct is shown below:

{
      bool serror_pending;
      bool serror_has_esr;
     u64  serror_esr;
}

Only when the target machine is armv8.2, it needs to set the
serror_esr(SError Exception Syndrome Register).
for the armv8.0,  software can not set the serror_esr(SError Exception
Syndrome Register).
so when migration from v8.{0,1} to v8.2, QEMU should make up an impdef
serror_esr for the v8.2 target.
can you give me some suggestion how to set that register in the QEMU?
I do not familar with the QEMU migration.
Thanks very much.

how about KVM set again to the same VCPU?
