Hmm. Is this limitation just that compilers have not implemented
out-of-line support for stack instrumentation, or is there a deeper
reason that stack/global instrumentation relies upon inline
instrumentation?

I ask because it's very common on ppc64 to have the virtual address
space split up into discontiguous blocks. I know this means we lose
inline instrumentation, but I didn't realise we'd also lose stack and
global instrumentation...

I wonder if it would be worth, in the distant future, trying to
implement a smarter scheme in compilers where we could insert more
complex inline mapping schemes.

Regards,
Daniel
