There is no method to force an RC to forward requests p2p. RC's are also not required to support p2p and whether they do or not is implementation specific. There is also currently no PCIe based standard to determine whether an RC supports p2p or in what capacity. Also, even if p2p is supported, it might not be supported in a system that enables Virtualization (the Virtualization would have to setup p2p tables to allow it).

There is currently a PCIe ECR that has been submitted, but is undergoing review, that defines a PCIe capability for bridge devices (Root Ports and Switch Downstream Ports) that would allow them to advertise what level of p2p is supported by the device.

Not that I'm aware of, but the folks I cc'd would know a lot more about this area.
