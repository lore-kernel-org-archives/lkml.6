OK, I see. Is there any fundamental reason why this path has to do one
round of GFP_IO or it can keep NOWAIT, drop the lock, sleep and retry
again?

It is really hard to change rules during the game. You basically have to
examine all existing users and that is well beyond my time scope. I've
tried that where it was possible. E.g. __GFP_REPEAT and turned it into a
well defined semantic. __GFP_NORETRY is a bigger beast.

Anyway, I believe that it would be much safer to look at the problem
from a highlevel perspective. You seem to be focused on __GFP_NORETRY
little bit too much IMHO. We are not throttling callers which explicitly
do not want to or cannot - see current_may_throttle. Is it possible that
both your md and mempool allocators can either (ab)use PF_LESS_THROTTLE
or use other means? E.g. do you have backing_dev_info at that time?
