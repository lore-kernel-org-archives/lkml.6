I don't think there really is such a thing as "device driver state" (or
maybe I don't understand what you mean by it). The state is attached to
the individual device, isn't it?

Hm, isn't that transition happening when the mdev is created?

Now you have managed to confuse me completely... isn't the firmware
only handling the (real) subchannel state?

It might be good to combine the two.

How can something be operational if the device is not? It could be in a
state like the ccw device's disconnected state, but it's certainly not
ready for requests.

Ah, do you mean 'subchannel enabled'? I was thinking about 'device
dead, we get cc 3 or somesuch'.

See above. I think we'll get a notification from the common I/O layer,
and it probably makes sense to inject the same notification (CRW) into
the guest.

Yes, that's what I meant.

Agreed. But we should be able to find out whether we got a final state.

As long as we do update it some time before we need the information, ok.

It depends. We either get a deferred cc 3, or a machine check (but no
interrupt).

Ok. Although we probably don't need to dwell on this too much, the
"always cc 2 on xsch" approach should already cover guest usage, I
guess.

I'm not sure about that; csch/hsch are different. csch clears any other
pending state; hsch may return busy, pending on what is currently going
on.

For csch, that would be immediately after cc 0.

Yes, that's only for hsch, though.
