Thanks for the clarification, I see some possibilities for improving
this but it makes sense.

Forgive me if I misunderstand this, but isn't this exactly what I'm
trying to do in patch 3? Which stopped working back in v4.15-rc1, with
the introduction of f1d981eaecf8 ("PM / devfreq: Use the available
min/max frequency").

Thanks for sharing the current status and helping me understand how to
properly use devfreq.
