Well. If we would force the user to a two-step interaction, why not stay
completely in sysfs? So instead of using the save-for-unlock ioctl, we
could export each security provider( (AdminSP, UserSPX, ...) as a sysfs
directory with appropriate files (e.g. mbr for AdminSP) as well as a
'unlock' file to store a users password for the specific locking space
and a 'lock' file to remove the stored password on write to it.
Of course, while this will prevent from reuse of the ioctl and
stays within the same configuration method, the PW will still hang
around in the kernel between 'lock' and 'unlock'.

Another idea I just came across while writing this down:
Instead of storing/releasing the password permanently with the 'unlock' and
'lock' files, those may be used to start/stop an authenticated session.
To make it more clear what I mean: Each ioctl that requires
authentication has a similar pattern:
discovery0, start_session, <do_work>, end_session
Instead of having the combination determined by the ioctl, the 'unlock'
would do discovery0 and start_session while the 'lock' would do the
end_session. The user is free to issue further commands with the
appropriate write/reads to other files of the sysfs-directory.
While this removes the requirement to store the key within kernel space,
the open session handle may be used from everybody with permissions for
read/write access to the sysfs-directory files. So this is not optimal
as not only the user who provided the password will finally be able to use
it.
I already did some basic work to split of the session-information from
the opal_dev struct (initially to reduce the memory-footprint of devices with
currently no active opal-interaction). So I think, I could get a
proof-of-concept of this approach within the next one or two weeks if
there are no objections to the base idea.

Thank you,
 Jonas
