This is one area where we can improve things.

Perhaps the typical use case for the kernel for looking for stable fixes is to
groom for good candidate fixes using some heuristics, test compile and if there
is no issue merge. It would be not so different than a human using their own
experience of some sort using a pattern to do the same. However the big
difference for filesystems is we *need* proper testing.

The issue with filesystems is the consequence of a bug are much more severe
than just a panic. Any corner case issue can really be much more critical than
just crashing a system. Ruining your filesystem is simply unforgivable,
specially if all that was missing was a proper regression test, and we already
have infrastructure for it.

The good news is that we have proper a proper testing suite to help out, and as
per my inspection 0-day already embraces a few tests. We can do a bit more here
for expanding on these... but also use a baseline for testing proposed XFS stable
fixes. For now I suggest a bit of manual work and I can volunteer to lead this
on, with a transparent mechanism to enable other folks to reproduce similar
testing in an easy way. I had in mind a mechanism to automate this long term,
and I started working on something, so I can use that to start this effort,
and publish what I have soon.

But that would not be enough, we need proper testing and careful oversight. I
can volunteer to review the patches manually (any others?) and if any questions
come up bring them up and check / verify with others.

The new autoselection truly is state of the art and we'd be silly to not
address corner cases for subsystems to help take advantage of the candidate
patches it provides. My inspection so far revealed only one possible issue
fix, that is not bad at all.

Is there a temporary tree with all the patches already merged by any chance?
That would help with testing the queue of candidate fixes.

What I propose is for XFS we add a few more steps:

1a. Ensure the fixes are in a temporary tree
1b. Add me to the list of reviewers
1c. I'll run some tests against it compared to a baseline which would be
    pre-established
1d. While the tests are running do a manual inspection of the patches
1e. Only if patches produce no regressions with the established baseline and get
    a Reviewed-by by at least one developer do we publish to stable

I can work on establishing the baseline with the community next.

filesystems are the same -- the issue is the risk of an issue is much more
severe.

Indeed. I have addressed the stable question on XFS in person with at the small
BoF at Vault last year, and with other folks later. The current process may
work for some... but I think we can do better and it just requires volunteers,
and I think using the auto-selection process to come up with *candidates* is a
great opportunity, specially in light of the patches I have seen so far already
merged.

My testing of them also proved no regressions (modulo I skipped the one I
pointed out on this thread.

We need testing. Without testing this cannot fly.
