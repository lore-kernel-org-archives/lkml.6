Say, a value that we generally pass to close system call is not static
and can't be dumped to a static file. It's whatever a previous open
system call has returned. Inside of the program we memorize the return
value of open in a variable and then pass it to close. This generally
stands for all system calls. Say, an image can contain an uid, and
that uid can be obtained from a system call too.

Suggestions are welcome. Currently it says "syzbot hit the following
crash on upstream commit SHA1", which was supposed to mean just the
state of the source tree when the crash happened. But I am not a
native speaker, so perhaps I am saying not what I intend to say.

There are also suggestions on report format improvement from +Ted
currently in works:
https://github.com/google/syzkaller/issues/565#issuecomment-380792942
Not sure if they make this distinction 100% clear, though.

syzkaller can generate/mutate images based on structured format
templates, but for now we don't have any templates and these are just
opaque blobs.
