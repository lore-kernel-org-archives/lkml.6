I'm afraid you've lost me now - it was not pushed behind your back,
it was posted for review, with you on the CC list. Not trying to
be deliberately dense here, I just don't see what our disagreement is.

It's not hard to run the quick struct layout checks or alignment. If
there's a concern, that should be done now, instead of being deferred to
later. There's no point merging something that we expect to have
follow-on work. If that's the case, then it should not be merged. There
are no dependencies in the patchset, except that the last patch
obviously can't be applied until all of the previous ones are in.

I took a quick look at the struct mapped_device layout, which I'm
assuming is the most important on the dm side. It's pretty big to
begin with, obviously this makes it bigger since we're now
embedding the bio_sets. On my config, doesn't show any false sharing
that would be problematic, or layout changes that would worry me. FWIW.
