NVMe on the other hand does have support for separate read and write
buffers as in the current SCSI bidi support, as it encodes the data
transfers in that SQE.  So IFF NVMe does bidi commands it would have
to use a single buffer for data in/out, which can be easily done
in the block layer without the current bidi support that chains
two struct request instances for data in and data out.

Due to the way we use request chaining we need two fields at the
moment.  ->special and ->next_rq.  If we'd refactor the whole thing
for the basically non-existent user we could indeed probably get it
down to a single pointer.

The way I read SAM data needs to be transferred to the device for
processing first, then the processing occurs and then it is transferred
out, so the order seems fixed.

For NVMe they'd need to transfer data in and out in the same buffer
to sort work, and even then only if we don't happen to be bounce
buffering using swiotlb, or using a network transport.  Similarly for
SCSI only iSCSI at the moment supports bidi CDBs, so we could have
applications using vendor specific bidi commands on iSCSI, which
is exactly what we're trying to find out, but it is a bit of a very
niche use case.
