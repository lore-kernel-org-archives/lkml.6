From: Alan Stern <stern@rowland.harvard.edu>

Since commit 76ebbe78f739 ("locking/barriers: Add implicit
smp_read_barrier_depends() to READ_ONCE()") was merged for the 4.15
kernel, it has not been necessary to use smp_read_barrier_depends().
Similarly, commit 59ecbbe7b31c ("locking/barriers: Kill
lockless_dereference()") removed lockless_dereference() from the
kernel.

Since these primitives are no longer part of the kernel, they do not
belong in the Linux Kernel Memory Consistency Model.  This patch
removes them, along with the internal rb-dep relation, and updates the
revelant documentation.
