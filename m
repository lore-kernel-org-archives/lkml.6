Maybe my generic description didn't highlight how plain are.

If you print, e.g., io_serviced with the current interface, you get

--------------------------

8:0 Read 4291168
8:0 Write 2181577
8:0 Sync 5897755
8:0 Async 574990
8:0 Total 6472745
Total 6472745

--------------------------

With the new, interface, you get *the same output*, if only one policy
is attached to this interface file.  In, instead
- two policies share
the the file, because one is active on a device and one on another
device
- these policies are named, e.g., bfq and pol2
then you get (device number and statistics invented):

--------------------------

bfq:
8:0 Read 4291168
8:0 Write 2181577
8:0 Sync 5897755
8:0 Async 574990
8:0 Total 6472745
Total 6472745

pol2:
16:0 Read 238768
16:0 Write 323123
16:0 Sync 43243
16:0 Async 432432
16:0 Total 412435
Total 4341244

--------------------------

So you see the per-device statistics as before, without the problem
of inventing a new set of names for every new policy that has the same
interface files of an existing policy.

Tejun, let's try to converge, to whatever solution you prefer.


4.21 is coming ...  and the legacy proportional share interface will
be gone with cfq.  This will break legacy code using the
proportional-share interface on top of bfq.  This code may just fail
when trying to use interface files that don't exist any longer.

Thanks,
Paolo
