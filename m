In case of bios in one request, we can't know how many bvecs there
are except for calling rq_bvecs(), so it may not be suitable to
preallocate the table. If you have to send the IO request in one send(),
runtime allocation may be inevitable.

If you don't require to send the IO request in one send(), you may send
one bio in one time, and just uses the bio's bvec table directly,
such as the single bio case in lo_rw_aio().

Yeah, that is the most common example, given merge is enabled
in most of cases. If the driver or device doesn't care merge,
you can disable it and always get single bio request, then the
bio's bvec table can be reused for send().

rq_for_each_bvec() will iterate over all bvecs from all bios, so you
needn't to see any bio in this req.

rq_bvecs() will return how many bvecs there are in this request(cover
all bios in this req)

I guess I may not get your exact requirement on block io iterator from nvme-tcp
too, :-(
