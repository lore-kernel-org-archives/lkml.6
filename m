Sure, asking for guarantee makes hugetlb pages attractive. But nothing
is really for free, especially any resource _guarantee_, and you have to
pay an additional configuration price usually.

Why? I can see this would be quite a PITA but not really impossible.

Not really, you can specify how much you can overcommit hugetlb pages.
