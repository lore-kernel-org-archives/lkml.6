Oh, My bad.

The HW design assigned a bus address range(typically start from
0x2000_0000 to 0x2fff_ffff for both mt2712 and mt7622) for PCIe usage.
This means, when CPU or other HW access address in this range, PCIe RC
HW should response to this access. Normally it will translate those
access request to TLPs and send to EP side. Tt's like the total memory
resource which could be allocated by EP's BAR and RC's itself BAR.

Although those address range is available for allocated, but it should
be enabled by this PCIE_AHB_TRANS_BASE register, what size should be
enabled is determined by AHB2PCIE_SIZE bits in this register.

In previous code we did not enable the full size of HW assigned address
range, if the EP's BAR requested size is bigger than the size we enabled
and smaller than the HW available size. The access request from CPU
which address is bigger than the address we enabled but smaller that HW
available address, then RC will block those request and those request
will never get to EP side by TLPs.

Previous code never run into a system error in production because even
half of those range(128MB) is bigger enough for typical EP device's BAR
request(4MB).

But all those HW assigned bus range should be enabled. And it's Okay to
do that. RC will never forward a request to EP when this request is not
suitable for EP's BAR range.

Okay, thanks for your advise.

Okay, will update this in next version.

Thanks for your comments.
