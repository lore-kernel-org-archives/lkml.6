Maybe drop a sentence in here that this makes heavy usage of the s390
virtualization facilities, which do the heavy lifting?

Do you also want to explain how these entities show up on the ap bus in
Linux? It might make the explanations further down easier to
understand. (Is there any document for the ap bus you could point to?)

Call this "AP and SIE" or so? You're not trying to explain the whole
SIE architecture :)

Thank you for including diagrams, these are really helpful.

The cpu model interface is supposed to be user space agnostic, although
it is only used by QEMU in practice. Mark this as an example more
clearly?

I have not looked at this in detail (will probably come back to this
later), but this looks like a useful document.
