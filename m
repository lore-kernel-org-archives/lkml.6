We could, but combined with your later request for indentation, we end
up with something like this:

	$ norm7 -bell linux-kernel.bell \
		Rfi Once PodRR Once Fre Once Rfi Once PodRR Once Fre Once | \
	  sed -e 's/:.*//g'
	SB+rfionceonce-poonceonces

In the immortal words of MSDOS, are you sure?  ;-)

Right you are!  How about this, then?

Rfi: Read-from internal.  The current process wrote a variable and then
        immediately read the value back from it.  For the purposes of
        litmus-test code generation, Rfi acts identically to PosWR.
        However, they differ for purposes of naming, and they also result
        in different "exists" clauses.

If you didn't know better, you might even think that I was a native
