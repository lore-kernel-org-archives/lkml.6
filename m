Although I do not have the hardware to test the builds, I worked closely with 
the OP in the bug at b.r.c noted above. From that effort, it became clear what 
configuration variables were missing to cause the x86 failures. Patch 2 
satisfies the requirement, and prevents the build problems found by the MIPS 
users. Both patches are needed in 4.17.
