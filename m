Hi Rick!

Sorry for the delay. I'd like to take a step back and ask some broader questions -

- Is the end goal of this patchset to randomize loading kernel modules, or most/all
   executable kernel memory allocations, including bpf, kprobes, etc?

- It seems that a lot of complexity and heuristics are introduced just to
   accommodate the potential fragmentation that can happen when the module vmalloc
   space starts to get fragmented with bpf filters. I'm partial to the idea of
   splitting or having bpf own its own vmalloc space, similar to what Ard is already
   implementing for arm64.

   So a question for the bpf and x86 folks, is having a dedicated vmalloc region
   (as well as a seperate bpf_alloc api) for bpf feasible or desirable on x86_64?

   If bpf filters need to be within 2 GB of the core kernel, would it make sense
   to carve out a portion of the current module region for bpf filters?  According
   to Documentation/x86/x86_64/mm.txt, the module region is ~1.5 GB. I am doubtful
   that any real system will actually have 1.5 GB worth of kernel modules loaded.
   Is there a specific reason why that much space is dedicated to kernel modules,
   and would it be feasible to split that region cleanly with bpf?

- If bpf gets its own dedicated vmalloc space, and we stick to the single task
   of randomizing *just* kernel modules, could the vmalloc optimizations and the
   "backup" area be dropped? The benefits of the vmalloc optimizations seem to
   only be noticeable when we get to thousands of module_alloc allocations -
   again, a concern caused by bpf filters sharing the same space with kernel
   modules.

   So tldr, it seems to me that the concern of fragmentation, the vmalloc
   optimizations, and the main purpose of the backup area - basically, the more
   complex parts of this patchset - stems squarely from the fact that bpf filters
   share the same space as modules on x86. If we were to focus on randomizing
   *just* kernel modules, and if bpf and modules had their own dedicated regions,
   then I *think* the concrete use cases for the backup area and the vmalloc
   optimizations (if we're strictly considering just kernel modules) would
   mostly disappear (please correct me if I'm in the wrong here). Then tackling the
   randomization of bpf allocations could potentially be a separate task on its own.

Thanks!

Jessica
