FWIW, RISC-V landed in GCC 7.  The 7.3.0 release (and binutils-2.30) is the 
first one we recommend for kernel development as there have been a handful of 
bug fixes, but there's nothing major.  SiFive ships GCC versions with a few 
extra patches applied, and while I still recommend people use these they should 
all be performance improvements at this point.  With compilers you never know 
if a performance improvement is hiding a bug, but what's tagged as gcc-7.3.0 
passes the test suite.

Our 32-bit glibc port isn't upstream yet, but our 32-bit kernel is a bit of a 
mess so that's not the blocking issue in rv32-land right now :).
