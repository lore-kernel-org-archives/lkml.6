The reason is that the SDIO code has been derived mainly from qcacld and ath6kl
and they don't implement napi.

ath10k_htt_txrx_compl_task is currently only called from the napi poll function,
and the sdio bus driver doesn't have such a function.

An equivalent for SDIO would most likely be *ath10k_htt_htc_t2h_msg_handler*
or any of the other functions called from this function.

*ath10k_txrx_tx_unref* is actually called from *ath10k_htt_htc_t2h_msg_handler*,
so that function could be viewed as an equivalent.

If the call should be added in the bus driver (sdio.c) it should most likely be
placed in *ath10k_sdio_mbox_rx_process_packets*

		if (!pkt->trailer_only) {
			ep->ep_ops.ep_rx_complete(ar_sdio->ar, pkt->skb);
			ath10k_mac_tx_push_pending(ar_sdio->ar);
		} else {
			kfree_skb(pkt->skb)
		}

The above call would of course result in lot's of calls to *ath10k_mac_tx_push_pending*
Adding a htt_num_pending check here wouldn't look nice.

The HL RX path differs from the LL path in that the t2h_msg_handler returns
false indicating that it has consumed the skb.

This is because it is the HL RX indication handler that delivers the skb's
to mac80211.

Another solution could be to add an *else-statement* as a part of the *if (release)*
in *ath10k_htt_htc_t2h_msg_handler*, where *ath10k_mac_tx_push_pending* could be called.

Something like this perhaps:

	/* Free the indication buffer */
	if (release)
		dev_kfree_skb_any(skb);
	else if (!ar->htt.num_pending_tx)
		ath10k_mac_tx_push_pending(ar);

I think I prefer your original patch though.

Just out of curiosity, where did the limit of 3 come from?
If it works with a limit of 0, I think it should be used instead.

Another intersting thing that I stumbled upon when looking into the
code (while writing this email) is the *wake_up(&htt->empty_tx_wq);*

For some reason I have considered it not to be applicable for HL devices.

The queue is waited for in the flush op (*ath10k_flush*).
I am unsure what it is used for, but I don't think it affects the TX
deadlock scenario.
