But it does, as I also wrote in that first email. The legacy queue
flags had QUEUE_FLAG_ADD_RANDOM set by default, the MQ ones do not.
Hence any non-sd device would previously ALWAYS have ADD_RANDOM
set, now none of them do. Also see the patch I sent.

But you are missing my point - if we're mostly weeding out predictable
signals, then it's pointless to take the overhead of the randomness.
This is why the MQ flag don't include it by default.

That's not true, lots of devices have VERY predictable discard timings.
Most of them will have a fixed discards-per-second rate, even.
