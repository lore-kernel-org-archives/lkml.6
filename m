You want the barrier _before_ the call to __raw_writel() - you need to
ensure that writes to memory are emitted by the compiler _before_ the
write to the hardware - the write to the hardware may start DMA, and it
may be reading data that the program thinks it previously wrote.

Similarly, for readl(), you need the barrier after __raw_readl() to
ensure that other reads in the program aren't scheduled before a
potential DMA status register read.
