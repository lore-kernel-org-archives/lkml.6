If you clone or allocate a bio, you are the owner of bi_private. If
someone further down the stack clones it again, then they own the NEW
bi_private of the newly returned cloned. Nobody will mess with yours,
that would be a layering violation. That is the way to store data on a
per bio basis, not by adding a new random field to the bio structure.
