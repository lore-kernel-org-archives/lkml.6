I used those originally, but of course those definitions predate PCIe
so they aren't clearly related to a Requester ID.

I searched the PCIe spec for the specifics of the Requester ID
composition.  It was surprisingly hard to find a clear statement.  The
best I found was PCIe r4.0, sec 6.13, which says

    Routing IDs, Requester IDs, and Completer IDs are 16-bit
    identifiers traditionally composed of three fields: an 8-bit Bus
    Number, a 5-bit Device Number, and a 3-bit Function Number.

Even that isn't specific about where the fields are, 

But it's probably not worth obsessing over this and PCI_SLOT() and
PCI_FUNC() are definitely more readable, so I changed them.
