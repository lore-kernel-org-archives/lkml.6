Thanks a lot for that.

The only thing I can come up with is to have a requester-specific
callback that would get called when doing a requester-specific
disable_irq(). This callback would have to disable the interrupt at the
source level, instead of doing it at the irqchip level (and would only
make sense for shared interrupts).

You'd need a per-action refcount so that enable/disable can nest, and
some new APIs to request, enable and disable specific actions.

I could look into it if there would be more than one user...

Thanks,
