The additional piece of information is the "as if" rule.  If the compiler
can prove that the visible effects of running the program will be the
same with and without a given optimization, or "as if" the optimization
had not been applied, then it is allowed to apply the optimization.

The thing that prevents the compiler from using the "as if" rule in your
example is the call to synchronize_rcu(), which could do pretty much
anything, as far as the compiler can tell.  We use barrier() in many of
the atomic operations and memory barriers for the same reason.

But what are our options?  Here are the ones I can see at the moment:

1.	Status quo.  This works reasonably well, but we have already
	seen that your scenario makes it ask for more synchronization
	than necessary.  Of course, asking for a bit too much is better
	than asking for a bit too little, but I hope that we can do
	better than that.  (Hey, it seemed like a good idea at the
	time!)

	This includes the workaround, so status quo is OK for the
	near future.

2.	Make the C-language notion of control dependencies match the
	assembly-language notion.  I believe that this would work
	well, but it might break when we introduce unmarked accesses.
	It might be the case that such breakage only happens when
	there is a data race, but I am not certain of this.  I can
	dream, can't I?  ;-)

3.	Introduce a new marking/attribute in the .def file that indicates
	whether an access is volatile or implies a compiler barrier.
	This might allow herd to be more selective about control dependencies,
	for example, extending them past the end of "if" statements
	containing compiler barriers.

	One tricky aspect of this approach is working out what the
	compiler can do to the "if" statement.	We definitely do not
	want to put the complexity of all possible compilers into herd!

4.	A similar effect could be achieved by running the litmus test
	through a script that does transformations similar to the
	workaround.

5.	We could use some pragmatic heuristic in herd, but allow
	alternative "if" keywords that force control dependencies
	to extend past the end of the "if" statement on the one hand
	or to be limited to the "if" statement on the other.

6.	Your ideas here!
