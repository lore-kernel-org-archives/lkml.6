"conventions in a subsystem" my ass. That's brainless copy-pasting.

It was added by

f6edea77c8c8 ("ACPI, APEI, CPER: Cleanup CPER memory error output format")

and then replicated everywhere.

It is simply a dumb way of writing:

	snprintf(newpfx, sizeof(newpfx), "%s ", pfx);

Two can play that game: you get to keep it if you give a good reason
why.

Yes, at least for the most prominent ones.

If we can't decode it, *then* you dump it:

	"Unrecognized type: 0x%llx ..."

1. No one stares at the raw value if the bits are decoded
2. MCA_STATUS is one register - this error record is huge.

Fair enough. Only if it makes sense.
