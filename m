AFAIK, in ACPI based dynamic reconfiguration, there is no clear
indicator. In theory, If the ACPI tables have the hotpluggable
CPU resources, the OS can support physical hotplug.

For your machine, Did your CPUs support multi-threading, but not enable
it?

And, sometimes we should not trust the number of possible CPUs. I also
met the situation that BIOS told to ACPI that it could support physical
CPUs hotplug, But actually, there was no hardware slots in the machine.
the ACPI tables like user inputs which should be validated when we use.

Do we have to map the vectors to CPU statically? Can we map them when
we hotplug/enable the possible CPU?

Thanks,
