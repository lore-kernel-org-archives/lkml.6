Someone actually asked this question at the Maintainer's Summit,
actually.  The answer was that the Fixes line is not sufficient for
Greg's scripts; you have to have the "Cc: stable" line as well.  Greg
tried using the Fixes line as a trigger, but there were too many cases
where this pulled in commits that weren't really suitable for the
Stable kernels.  Sasha's machine-learning lash up will use the Fixes
line as a signal, but if you want to explicitly request that the patch
should be cherry-picked into Stable, you should have the "Cc: stable"
line.

(Also mentioned that at the Maintainer's Summit was that we probably
do need to take a look at the Stable documentation and see how it
needs to be updated to reflect how things are currently behind
handled.  :-)

Cheers,
