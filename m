But we want to enforce the compat check on MTD devices, otherwise old
MTD partitions (those defined under the MTD node) will be considered as
NVMEM cells by the NVMEM framework. Hence the bool check_cells_compat
field.

I'm fine using a different name.

Yes, I agree. Just thought it was important to have this solution in
the list, even if it's just to reject it.

Agree. I was just pointing it in case you hadn't noticed.

And I'm not talking about adding SW information in the DT, I'm talking
about HW specific description. We have the same solution for pinctrl
configs (it's HW/driver specific).

No because partitions defined the old way (as direct subnodes of the MTD
node) will be considered as NVMEM cells by the NVMEM framework, and I
don't want that. Plus, I don't want people to start defining their
NVMEM cells and forget the compat string (which would work just fine
because the NVMEM framework doesn't care).

Except that's just in theory. In practice, if people can do something
wrong, they'll complain if you later fix the bug and break their setup.
So no, if we go for the "nvmem cells have an 'nvmem-cell' compat", then
I'd like the NVMEM framework to enforce that somehow.
