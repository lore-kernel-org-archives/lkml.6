I don't think you're missing anything :/

Having two flags like you suggest could work. Or you could just make the
flag into a nesting counter.

Or do you just remove the clearing from spin_lock()? 

That gets you:

 	spin_lock(&foo);
 	outb(42, port);		// io_sync = 1
 	spin_lock(&bar);
 	...
 	spin_unlock(&bar);	// mb(); io_sync = 0
 	spin_unlock(&foo);


And I/O outside of the lock case:

 	outb(42, port);		// io_sync = 1

 	spin_lock(&bar);
 	...
 	spin_unlock(&bar);	// mb(); io_sync = 0


Extra barriers are not ideal, but the odd spurious mb() might be
preferable to doing another compare and branch or increment in every
spin_lock()?

cheers
