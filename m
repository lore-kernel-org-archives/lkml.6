Let me be evil again and let me quote the old discussion:

: Currently, it is not a problem - device mapper reports the device as
: congested only if the underlying physical disks are congested.
:
: But once we change it so that device mapper reports congested state on its
: own (when it has too many bios in progress), this starts being a problem.

So has this changed since then? If yes then we can think of a proper
solution but that would require to actually describe why we see the
congestion, why it does help to wait on the caller rather than the
allocator etc...

Throwing statements like ...

... is not really productive. I've tried to explain why I am not _sure_ what
possible side effects such a change might have and your hand waving
didn't really convince me. MD is not the only user of the page
allocator...

E.g. why has 41c73a49df31 ("dm bufio: drop the lock when doing GFP_NOIO
allocation") even added GFP_NOIO request in the first place when you
keep retrying and sleep yourself? The changelog only describes what but
doesn't explain why. Or did I misread the code and this is not the
allocation which is stalling due to congestion?
