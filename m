I don't have a good answer to this right now. I'm going to have to review
this portion of the spec, as well as the implementation to understand what
went wrong.

As for changing UAPI, I know that's usually a no-go, but no one actually
uses this portion of the opal driver as far as I can tell. No distro ships
sed-util, and enabling/disabling the mbr is a one shot deal during initial
bring up. If I had messed up the resume from suspsend portion we wouldn't
be able to change that, as I know people use that. But for this part I think
we'd be okay to do this small modification.

If util-linux, will take a patch for the opal driver, then
we'd be locked in for 5.1 or when ever this lands (as distros would now be
shipping).

Anyway, let me review again whats happened here over the weekend when I have
some free time and mental cycles left to spare.
