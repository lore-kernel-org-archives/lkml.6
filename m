I already started on removing the MLC bits in previous patches. These 
two patches continue that trend. I don't know of any implementing either 
multiple groups or MLC, and since it has not been implemented before, no 
one is going to use it. No reason to have dead code hanging around. This 
is similar to the NVMe device driver not having definitions for all that 
is in the specification until it is used in the implementation.
