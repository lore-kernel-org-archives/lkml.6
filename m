In this case, work should still be queued only once. The synchronization in
this case should be provided by the WORK_STRUCT_PENDING_BIT. When a delayed
work is queued by mod_delayed_work(), this bit is set, and gets cleared
only once the work is started on some CPU. But admittedly this code is
rather convoluted so I may be missing something.

Also you should note that flush_delayed_work() which follows
mod_delayed_work() in wb_shutdown() does del_timer_sync() so I don't see
how anything could get past that. In fact mod_delayed_work() is in
wb_shutdown() path to make sure wb_workfn() gets executed at least once
before the bdi_writeback structure gets cleaned up so that all queued items
are finished. We do not rely on it to remove pending timers or queued
wb_workfn() executions.
