Right, I ran some tests and figured out that to have root_domain in the
child cgroup level, we do need to disable load balancing at the root
cgroup level and enabling it in child cgroups that are mutually disjoint
in their cpu lists. The cpu_exclusive flag isn't really needed.

I am not against doing that at the root cgroup, but it is kind of weird
in term of semantics. If we disable load balancing in the root cgroup,
but enabling it at child cgroups, what does that mean to the processes
that are still in the root cgroup?

The sched_load_balance flag isn't something that is passed to the
scheduler. It only only affects the CPU topology of the system. So I
suspect that a process in the root cgroup will be load balanced among
the CPUs in the one of the child cgroups. That doesn't look right unless
we enforce that no process can be in the root cgroup in this case.

Real cpu isolation will then require that we disable load balancing at
root, and enable load balancing in child cgroups that only contain CPUs
outside of the isolated CPU list. Again, it is still possible that some
tasks in the root cgroup, if present, may be using some of the isolated
CPUs.

Maybe we can have a different root level flag, say,
sched_partition_domain that is equivalent to !sched_load_balnace.
However, I am still not sure if we should enforce that no task should be
in the root cgroup when the flag is set.

Tejun and Peter, what are your thoughts on this?

Cheers,
Longman
