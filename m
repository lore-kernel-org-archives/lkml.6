Are you sure that it was not due to the docutils version?
I can't reproduce it but the table parser is a part of docutils.

Right, fix it by the markup .. is what I recommend.

The requirements.txt came from commit fb947f3f47 [1] (inital 24071ac1a6).
Where Jon and Mauro decided to tag explicit versions ...

docutils==0.12
Sphinx==1.4.9
sphinx_rtd_theme

Maybe it is time to switch to something like .. ?

Sphinx>=1.4.9
sphinx_rtd_theme

I don't know. Mauro has tested on many distros, he has more experience with
the wide range of distros then I.

The reST markup is specified here:

 http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html

but the (last) example of the simple table does not match your "1.4.9"
experience.
