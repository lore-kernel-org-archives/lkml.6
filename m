+=====================
+Overcommit Accounting
+=====================
+
 The Linux kernel supports the following overcommit handling modes
 
-0	-	Heuristic overcommit handling. Obvious overcommits of
-		address space are refused. Used for a typical system. It
-		ensures a seriously wild allocation fails while allowing
-		overcommit to reduce swap usage.  root is allowed to 
-		allocate slightly more memory in this mode. This is the 
-		default.

-		entirely of zero pages.

-2	-	Don't overcommit. The total address space commit

-		pages but will receive errors on memory allocation as

 Gotchas
--------
+=======
 
 The C language stack growth does an implicit mremap. If you want absolute
-guarantees and run close to the edge you MUST mmap your stack for the 
+guarantees and run close to the edge you MUST mmap your stack for the
 largest size you think you will need. For typical stack usage this does
 not matter much but it's a corner case if you really really care
 
-In mode 2 the MAP_NORESERVE flag is ignored.

 How It Works
-------------
+============
 
 The overcommit is based on the following rules
 
 For a file backed map
-	SHARED or READ-only	-	0 cost (the file is the map not swap)
-	PRIVATE WRITABLE	-	size of mapping per instance
+	| SHARED or READ-only	-	0 cost (the file is the map not swap)
+	| PRIVATE WRITABLE	-	size of mapping per instance
 
-For an anonymous or /dev/zero map
-	SHARED			-	size of mapping
-	PRIVATE READ-only	-	0 cost (but of little use)
-	PRIVATE WRITABLE	-	size of mapping per instance
+For an anonymous or ``/dev/zero`` map
+	| SHARED			-	size of mapping
+	| PRIVATE READ-only	-	0 cost (but of little use)
+	| PRIVATE WRITABLE	-	size of mapping per instance
 
 Additional accounting
-	Pages made writable copies by mmap
-	shmfs memory drawn from the same pool

 Status
-------
-
-o	We account mmap memory mappings
-o	We account mprotect changes in commit
-o	We account mremap changes in size
-o	We account brk
-o	We account munmap
-o	We report the commit status in /proc
-o	Account and check on fork
-o	Review stack handling/building on exec
-o	SHMfs accounting
-o	Implement actual limit enforcement
