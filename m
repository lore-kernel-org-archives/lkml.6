Wesley, I'm going to suggest you send patches to me before sending them
to the community until you have a better handle of the tools and
process. The subject suggests you have 11 other patches in this series
so you've mishandled the tools.

The commit message is poorly formatted/wrapped and with all due respect,
I think the grammar needs a lot of work.

The change itself looks good.
